<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/4/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture is erased and another picture is dropped on
    top, the erased picture loses its parts and gains the parts of the picture on top. (As
    before it also gets the appearance of the picture on top.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copy an inactive picture then copy is also inactive
    now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Parts sensor now updates when the picture is flipped back
    over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems where pictures that got a new appearance
    by being erased and a new picture dropped on top didn't behave as they should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed an occasional problem where the hat or hair of the
    programmer wasn't displayed if a picture of the programmer had been added to another
    picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It used to be that Pumpy would not change the size of Tooly
    if 'G' for Good Size was selected.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/5/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem were if you erased the remote looks for a
    picture and dropped a picture with pictures on top the geometry of the pictures was wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another geometry problem with replacing the appearance
    of a picture with another.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now start and stop a picture by typing space or '.'
    to the remote control for the looks of the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture with pictures on top was saved where some of the
    parts were inactivated they are now inactive when restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes leaving ToonTalk and coming back and then making a
    user defined sound broke things. (Bug introduced in November.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/7/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;-language&quot; command line option now accepts
    &quot;PT&quot; as an abbreviation for Portuguese from Portugal.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In anticipation of major changes to birds so that they can
    fly between computers, you now get a nice warning if you try to load in a bird or nest
    which is network aware (even though no such birds and nests exist yet and won't for a
    couple of months).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/8/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The language specific DLLs now specify whether addresses
    should display as number followed by word or word followed by number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made changes to how Marty describes things so it works for
    grammars as different as English and Japanese.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/9/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to how Marty describes pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/10/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you change the color of a number (by flipping it over and
    using the &quot;Which Picture&quot; sensor) then it now saves correctly so that when
    reloaded it has the right color.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes pictures when flipped and
    then flipped back got the wrong size (the size they were when flipped).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to how Marty is saved if a city is saved
    while he is visible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is in a notebook or box, sometimes time was
    wasted checking if it was involved in any collisions.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/12/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos files were recording which voice Marty spoke with so it
    could not be overridden by the user.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/13/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way objects are saved and restored so they are
    restored with the identical appearance they had when saved - even if they were animating.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The main notebook now remembers better where you place him
    and uses it as a default next time you sit down.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/14/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the button on a magic wand
    wasn't placed right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/15/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Cities now save more things like whether the power is off or
    programmer is hidden.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">State of the programmer is now saved in cities more
    accurately.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/17/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now correctly save a city while holding a magic wand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/18/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now properly save a city where Dusty has erased things.
    Earlier strange things happened if you ran Dusty in reverse in the restored city.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk doesn't have enough time to do everything then
    some animation cycles are updated only every second or third time. The way this works was
    improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">More accurate saving and restoring of the appearance of
    objects (exact position and where in an animation cycle).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you erased something with Dusty, dropped the erased thing
    in a notebook, and then ran Dusty in reverse ToonTalk sometimes crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where some connections between objects were
    lost when the city was saved and restored.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/19/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If robots were running while a city was saved they are now
    restored so that they continue running where they were when saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the label of a notebook wasn't always
    displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you took the box that a robot was working on and dropped
    in a notebook (without grabbing the robot to stop him) ToonTalk sometimes crashed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/24/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of text pads sometimes changing
    when they shouldn't.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/25/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem specifying which demo to run where both the
    user and the system added DMO sometimes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk behaves better now if you give a full path name with
    extension to a sensor like &quot;file to picture&quot; and the file doesn't exist.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/26/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When displaying Unicode (e.g. Japanese) in a talk balloon it
    was not centered vertically well.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/27/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further changes to how Marty describes things so it
    works for grammars as different as English and Japanese.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty explains during the Puzzle Game how you can get hints
    from him in more appropriate contexts now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved how very long text strings (e.g. URLs) inside of
    talk balloons are displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unicode text fits much better now inside of talk balloons.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the notebook on the back of a
    picture became invisible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changing the width or height of a picture using remote
    controls sometimes also changed the x and y position sensors for the picture. This is
    because the x and y sensors measure where the center of the picture is from the edge of
    the screen (or picture it is on top of).&nbsp; You can add
    &quot;OldBehaviorWhenChangingSize=1&quot; to the &quot;Switches&quot; section of your
    toontalk.ini file to get the old behavior. The new behavior has the nice property that it
    doesn't matter what order you change the size and change the position of a picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/30/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where connections between saved objects
    wasn't restored properly occasionally.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/31/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty had something important to say
    but you were outside at the time and then sometimes he didn't beam in to tell you when
    walk inside a house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where robots where running, you turned off
    power, and then dropped the robots in a notebook where it sometimes crashed ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/1/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something goes wrong while saving a city a broken city
    file is no longer left behind. Instead a dialog box informs you of the problem and the old
    city file is left alone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed up both a picture and its remote looks and
    spit out the remote looks it behaved strangely.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading pictures where on the back is a robot
    with a remote looks of the picture in its thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a team of robots was stopped (e.g. by F8) and then part of
    the team vacuumed away and destroyed then when F8 was pressed again ToonTalk would
    sometimes crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A major new feature - time travel - started working (but is
    still buggy). See <a href="http://www.toontalk.com/English/ttravel.htm">www.toontalk.com/English/ttravel.htm</a>
    for details.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/2/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had troubles describing things that included a
    erased force feedback effect.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk saved remote controls using joysticks incorrectly -
    these are now loaded in OK anyway.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/3/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now put whole houses on the clipboard. Just type
    control-c while standing in a house and then type control-v while outside. A copy of the
    house will be built on the block you are on. Everything is saved - stuff in side and
    decoration.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/4/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A new sensor has been added to the 'Sensors' notebook. It
    shows the language (e.g. &quot;English&quot; or &quot;Swedish&quot;) that is currently in
    effect.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/6/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a general text-to-speech engine (not like the built-in one
    that causes Marty to spell things he can't say) is in effect then it is now passed text
    without any preprocessing to deal with numbers, hyphens, etc. This assumes the engine can
    do at least as good a job at this as ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more problems loading in remote controls for joystick
    buttons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you save something with user pictures or sounds in it,
    Marty gives you a warning. Repetitions of this warning for additional pictures or sounds
    is given a low importance and usually is not spoken but ends up in the user text log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the toontalk.ini &quot;Switches&quot; section has the
    entry &quot;DontOpenInternetConnection=1&quot; then ToonTalk will not even try to make an
    internet connection for reading URLs.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/7/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had a limit to the size of an encoding in a page of
    a notebook (64K). It now is limited by the general limit to encodings of 2,000,000.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems Marty had describing some kinds of remote
    controls with pictures for values.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes getting up from the ground altered the location of
    things left on the ground.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with pasting houses with the geometry of
    decorations.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/8/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The clipboard sensor now ignores rooms, houses, or cities on
    the clipboard. It only re-creates single objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Greatly improved the accuracy of the geometric relationship
    of pictures. This was causing small objects to get smaller (sometimes so small they
    couldn't be seen) and things on the wall decoration to drift to the left bottom corner.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A bad BMP file (one that Windows Paint can't read) sometimes
    crashed ToonTalk. Now a warning is presented and just that object isn't displayed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/9/00</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The recently introduce &quot;Copy of Me&quot; page of the
    remote control notebook of a picture has been decommisioned. It had various problems and
    there is a much better way of having a robot create a copy of a picture it is on the back
    of. It just erases a new picture and drops the remote control for the looks of a picture
    on it. A copy of the picture is produced.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some remote controls from the Options notebook overrode the
    setting of 'Set Options' because of the state they were saved in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you flipped over a picture you'd see robots on
    top of box. They are now always under the boxes.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a notebook was added to the main notebook and then taken
    out and put in another notebook, ToonTalk sometimes got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty gives an explanation of how to change pictures using
    '+' less often if you press space while pointing to or holding a picture and there is
    nothing on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now put anything on the back of a picture (except for
    Tooly and his friends).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F12 used to put a snapshot on the clipboard. Control-F12 does
    that now. F12 is now for tossing pictures. If you press F12 while holding a picture it
    will move off in the direction that it was recently moving. F11 no longer also does any
    kind of tossing but is exclusively for ignoring what is underneath.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed an occasional problem when saving a picture and its
    notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the remote control for the looks of something that
    has pictures on top of it would display the pictures on top intermittently.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem standing up while holding the magic wand and
    then sitting down again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you moved to the corner or wall while sitting on the
    floor in a resolution greater than 640x480 the wall or corner wasn't displayed correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed up Tooly and then vacuumed up other objects
    and spit them out again they began very narrow.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Standing up and sitting while Marty was talking sometimes
    resulting in a blank talk balloon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The variable width font text pads used in the built-in
    notebook now do not show the background (they are set to &quot;show some&quot; not
    &quot;show all&quot;).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to the accuracy of the geometry
    with which parts of a picture are saved and restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no longer a delay from when a picture is destroyed
    (e.g. dropped in a notebook) and its remote controls become inactive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A flipped picture used to match the same picture unflipped.
    No longer. Two flipped pictures match only if the would match if both were flipped over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that occurred while quitting ToonTalk with Tooly
    inside of Dusty.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty is able to describe trucks much better. And Marty
    didn't used to be able to describe trucks or notebooks if they were inside of something
    else.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many internal errors are now just added to the user's log
    file rather than spoken by Marty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The parts of a picture inside of a box in a thought bubble
    are not displayed since they are not considered in the matching process.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures inside of things sometimes forgot the &quot;good
    size&quot; when saved and restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping Tooly on a robot sometimes crashed ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Birds would sometimes incorrectly fly to their nest when it
    was in a box in a robot's thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nests in thought bubbles once again only match empty nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Corrupted files or clippings sometimes caused ToonTalk to
    freeze or crash. Now a nice error message appears and one can continue without the badly
    encoded objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping a remote control for the looks of a picture (A) on
    an erased picture (B) now copies the things on the back of the A and places them on B
    which becomes a complete copy of A - just the same as if the magic wand copied A. But
    robots can do this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now handles errors within errors better.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you didn't see what a bird was carrying.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now treats pictures in boxes given to robots that
    have remote controls for their looks in use as if it was a remote control itself. So
    robots won't quit but will wait for some other robot to change the picture via one of the
    remote controls for the looks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a scale had an ordinary number or text pad on
    its left and remote control on the right, that a robot would give up even though the value
    on the right might change tilting the scale so it matches.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you took out a team of robots of 3 or more, removed the
    first one and then either gave the others a box or put the one you removed on the team so
    it ends up at the end ToonTalk got confused and sometimes crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots wasted CPU time sometimes when the power was off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The encoding for objects for the clipboard now uses '-'
    instead of '/'. (Old clippings still work fine.) This is because many mailers thought that
    // at the beginning of a line indicated a file added &quot;file:&quot; which broke the
    encoding.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;Directories&quot; section of toontalk.ini can now
    have the entry FileSearchPath. This is a list of paths separated by semicolons. * is used
    to indicate the current user's name. For example, &quot;</font>FileSearchPath=c:\tmp;c:\temp\;*\sounds;http://www.toontalk.com/Pictures;http://www.toontalk.com/Sounds/;c:\*\puzzles;&quot;</li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Holding down shift while typing control-c puts an encoding of
    the object on the clipboard as before. But any user media (pictures or sounds) are saved
    with a reference to just the short file name and not the entire path that created it. This
    is especially useful for converting an application that uses URLs to references to local
    files to be found on the FileSearchPath entry.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The random number sensor now produces values from 0 to 999
    inclusive. 1,000 is no longer produced. This simplifies using it to compute other random
    numbers. For example, numbers from 0 to 9 by dividing by 100. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes text pads on the back of pictures became blank when
    there was a tiny remote looks of the picture also on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pumpy no longer changes the size of multiple objects. You
    need to turn him off and then on again to have him work on another object. This is because
    too often he changed the size of multiple objects unintentionally.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a text pad with a full path but no extension
    of a sensor like &quot;File to Picture&quot; it didn't work.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk used FileSearchPath for user files for notebooks and
    cities. This broke things if the FileSearchPath included URLs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User sounds defined by a URL were being saved referring to
    the temporary cache file name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If FileSearchPath includes a URL then files found are cached
    now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You sometimes saw what a bird was carrying even when the bird
    was flying from one place to another of the back of the same picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Containers sensor didn't update properly if in a box on
    the back of a picture and that picture was flipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stopped a picture (e.g. by typing '.' to it), then
    pictures inside of boxes on the back of the picture weren't stopped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 21 released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Boxes on walls (e.g. inside the rocket in the puzzle game)
    weren't displaying their contents right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way text is distributed when a subtitle needs
    more than one line.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where pictures were sometimes displayed with
    the wrong size when erased, replaced by another picture, saved, and then restored.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a month old problem where sometimes objects got stuck
    at such a small size that they couldn't be seen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes sensors got disconnected from their pictures when
    saved in a notebook (but not when saved in a city or the clipboard).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an error occurs saving something in a notebook, then
    ToonTalk gives users a warning and should neither crash nor destroy the item that was
    being saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty gave inappropriate advice if you
    typed space to a picture of a number or a remote conotrol for the looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented a new policy so that if unflipped pictures are on
    the back of pictures they run only when flipped. Unless they are in a box that a robot is
    working on - then they are active whether the picture is flipped or not.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dropping pictures on erased pictures where
    sometimes they ended up flipped and things on the back were lost.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Began to add more useful information to the user's log file
    as to why robot's stopped. For example, if a robot drops a picture on a number you now get
    descriptions of the items involved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The number of items that can be saved at one time was
    increased (the restriction is really on the number of items that are shared - e.g. birds
    of the same nest or sensors of the same picture - it is now 64K instead of 32K).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes loading cities that were saved
    while robots were running.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several memory leaks that caused ToonTalk to slow down
    and also to crash Windows after running ToonTalk for a long time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where only the version with debugging code
    run properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk didn't maintain log files
    unless time travel was enabled. In other words GenerateLogs can be set while
    SecondsBetweenLogs isn't.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk Beta 21A released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta22"><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/1</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot running on the back of a picture loads up a truck
    with an address (as well as a box and robot team), then a new house is made and the robot
    will run there. As before with no address the robot will run on the back of the picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot would wait for sensors to change when even
    if they did it would fail to match. The sensor now must be a cause of the robot failing to
    match.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange things sometimes happened if you vacuumed up Tooly
    the Toolbox and then set off a bomb.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem of vacuuming up Tooly the Toolbox and then
    sitting down in a new room.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem replaying logs of running the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way things work if you use both the -i and -o
    switches to read an old demo and write a new one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed demo logs so that can be created to either include a
    copy of the current notebook or to start with a new one (which will be different for
    different language versions of ToonTalk).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem preventing you from flipping over the remote
    looks of a picture and then dropping a flipped picture on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty didn't say the right things when
    you finished the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If somehow Tooly or his friends were saved with very large
    sizes, it is now fixed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">One way that Tooly was sometimes given a crazy size was when
    you ran free play, then play game, and then free play.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made small improvements to how demo logs are created.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When time travel is enabled the city is saved when you exit.
    This no longer happens if the exit was due to internal errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now suggests you try a higher screen resolution if
    you have a very high frame rate and are running 640x480 or higher. (Previously it only
    suggested this is if you were running 320x240.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You no longer see a bird fly to a nest on the back of a
    picture if she is coming from another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when a robot blew up a picture you were holding.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with how Marty spoke words with hyphens in
    them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem adding things to the back of a remote control
    for the looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote control for the looks of something sometimes
    changes size to match the size of the picture it is the remote looks of. This caused them
    to become very very small when the original picture was on the back of a picture in a box.
    This behavior now applies only if the size is more than a minimum (5% of screen width and
    height).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a month old bug in how robots were sometimes loaded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is part of a picture that is made so small that
    the picture gets a width or height of zero, it got stuck at that size even when expanded.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now puts up a nice dialog box when given an old demo
    file to run. (Old demos must be run by older versions of ToonTalk.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are using Pumpy to shrink something then he keeps
    shrinking it even if the end of his hose moves around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are using Pumpy to change something to a good size,
    the center of the object no longer moves.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a demo is being played with subtitles then Marty will use
    talk balloons even if subtitles were requested by 'Set Options'.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that prevent new demo log files from being
    run if the language DLL (e.g. usnt32.dll) was for an older version.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems with address remote controls when you
    changed them manually or turned them on and off. Thanks Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with boxes on pictures (currently only in the
    puzzle game - on the wall of the house or rocket).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the built-in notebooks lost
    their labels.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty beamed in to give some advice or warning then
    sometimes before leaving he would notice what you are pointing to or holding and start to
    give advice about that as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where the user log file gave
    the wrong puzzle numbers when running Play Game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The high screen resolutions can now run even if you don't
    have high resolution graphics (an m25 file from a CD-ROM installation). Text will be much
    sharper and you can shrink objects down and see them better.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Change of policy to what happens when remote controls of a
    picture are delivered by bird to a nest on the back on another picture. It used to be that
    the &quot;allegiance&quot; of the remote controls was switched to the new picture (that it
    is no the back of). This lead to unexpected behavior.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recent problem with describing pictures either by
    Marty or for the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes loading something containing a user picture whose
    file is no longer available led to instabilities.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a user picture is missing its file then as before it is
    replaced with a text pad with the file name on it. This pad was sometimes very large or
    small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem playing back demos that started in a saved
    city.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with demo logs of running the puzzle game.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fix for address remote controls on 3/13 broke keyboard
    actions on other remotes. They work fine now as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you typed 'u' (or the letter for your localized language
    version) while on the floor and your hand was empty then you stood up (unless the thing
    under your hand processed the 'u'). This now happens only if nothing is under your hand.
    Thanks to Ross for bringing this up. (On 3/22 also changed this so 'u' is ignored if you
    hide your hand.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some remaining places where Marty gives the obsolete
    advice that using space will change the value of a sensor. He now recommends you use '+'.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak when running narrated demos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo logs now recall whether they are using Unicode
    internally (e.g. for Japanese) and replay appropriately.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo logs also remember whether they were recorded with an
    alternate spoken language.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that Marty sometimes had when describing
    remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes dropping a picture with robots on the back on to a
    notebook caused it to have the wrong size when taken from the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while initializing ToonTalk couldn't find a file then the
    message box sometimes had only the file name in it. It now always has a message saying
    that the file couldn't be found.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where when running a demo log it created a
    file noname.txt rather than &lt;user name&gt;.txt. Where user name is the name used when
    creating the demo log.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you give a toss to a picture and drop it on another
    picture then the apparent speed is preserved. It used to be that the speed depended upon
    the size of the underlying picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now (once again) toss a picture that is still
    attached to a magic wand.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ask for a screen resolution that is greater than your
    computer is capable of it, you now get a warning it resets the default to the next smaller
    size.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">StartTT.exe can now show an AVI movie when started. Typically
    a publisher's logo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated 'Set Options' so that higher screen resolutions
    aren't disabled for non-CD-ROM installations.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Set Options' now displays your choice of voices for Marty
    even if only one is available.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems creating log files when the ToonTalk speed is
    set very low.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot is dropping something on a hole of a box that is
    occupied by certain remote controls (e.g. the Containers sensor), then it didn't work
    right if everything was very small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer supports multiple resolution of demos. If
    a demo requires say 640x480 screen resolution then that is how it will run regardless of
    the settings (e.g. 'Set Options').</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Marty speaks numbers in Portuguese (both
    Brazilian and European versions).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where robots are still
    running after flipping a picture over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes robots on the back of a picture wouldn't run when
    they should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a robot running on the back of a picture dropped
    something it became activated. This is costly and may not be the intended behavior and so
    is no longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty sometimes gave a warning about a
    robot having a box that doesn't match and no one he can give it to when an earlier robot
    in the team should suspend waiting for a sensor to change. Thanks to Jakob for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you used a sound defined by a user wave file, paused
    ToonTalk, and then vacuumed up the sound sometimes ToonTalk broke.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a limited text-to-speech engine is used like the default
    voices for Marty, then text-to-speech sounds now process the text to deal with some of
    these limitations. Numbers, for example, should be spoken correctly now. If a general
    text-to-speech engine is involved it is assumed it can handle any text.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sound pads now have a different color. This is so it is
    easier to see the difference between sounds and numbers. This change requires a new m25 or
    m22 file.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you press 'u' (or the localized equivalent) while sitting
    on the floor with an empty hand and not pointing to something, you'll stand up. This is no
    longer the case if you have made your hand invisible.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where upon exit, ToonTalk is trying to put up
    a dialog box asking if you want to learn how to change the screen resolution and strange
    things happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when running the built-in demos in ToonTalk
    where it didn't find the narration files on the ToonTalk CD-ROM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if ToonTalk is run directly after
    installation and before ever running 'Set Options' that some option settings were not so
    good.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now supports file extensions TT. If you double click
    on one of these (or click on a link to one from a web browser) then the ToonTalk object
    encoded in the text of the TT file is added to a running ToonTalk (when you are on the
    floor). If a ToonTalk isn't running one is launched. If no object is encoded by the TT
    file, then the text object of the contents of the TT file is loaded.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer suggests you run at a higher resolution if
    you are already running at 1024x768 or higher.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced a week earlier that caused Marty to
    reset his user profile so he treated every user as a new user.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running the Introductory Tour in some
    language versions where Marty stayed around and confused things during the first robot
    training.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a month old problem that sometimes caused teams of
    robots to not load in properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Encoded objects in TT files (see 3/25 entry) now run when
    added to the floor unless they were saved turned off.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture set off a bomb then the
    picture is destroyed. But for a short period after being destroyed it can be picked up by
    the &quot;Hit Who?&quot; sensor and trouble followed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to drop something on a hole and when
    running if the hole contains a parts or containers sensor then the thing dropped got
    passed to the box on the sensor. But if that box had more than one hole then it might end
    up on any of the holes. Now it is always the first hole. (If dropped by hand then the
    geometry of the drop determines where it ends up.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when some sensors were transferred (by robot) to
    the back of a new picture, then the value wasn't always updated and sometimes showed the
    value appropriate for the picture it was sensing before.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A few sensors like the clipboard sensor misbehaved if erased
    by Dusty and then the value changed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is erased and replaced by another picture that
    had been erased and replaced by another picture, then internally ToonTalk kept a chain of
    links that wasted time and memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak due to parts and containers sensors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a somewhat recent problem saving a city while on the
    floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where robots didn't always resume running
    when F8 was pressed for the second time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a picture with robots on the back was
    erased and another picture dropped on top.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if a picture was destroyed by a robot on the
    back while inside of a vacuum.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fix to problem on 3/26 where Marty treated everyone as a new
    user only worked if the user name was the same including case. The fix is now case
    insensitive.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another problem with pictures being destroyed by robots
    on the back setting off bombs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an internal error occurred while generating a comment or
    description of something placed on the clipboard then it no longer interferes with the
    save. The text of the description may be incomplete however.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred while describing a
    team of robots on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes robots on the back of pictures would stop working
    until you dropped the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if an earlier robot in a team failed to match
    because of the current value of a sensor and they were running on the back of a picture
    the team didn't wait for the sensor to change.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Put in better error checking if a sound comment was added to
    something and something was wrong with the sound.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot flipped over the remote looks of a picture it was
    on the back of, he sometimes stopped working right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading robots that were saved while they
    were running.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released version 2.02 and Beta 22.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some recent fixes to Marty made it so he didn't give advice
    unless called by the user.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug that can cause ToonTalk to
    crash while quitting.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the final puzzle file in a sequence contains just the name
    of an HTML file (.htm or .html) then the puzzle game is terminated and the user's web
    browser is launched on the file. Good for ending your own puzzle sequence.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with birds releasing things on the back of
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot to work on a box containing the
    &quot;containers&quot; sensor of a picture, it used to become a zero-hole box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem training a robot to work on a flipped picture
    where its parts disappeared during training.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where if a box with a
    picture in it was dropped into the hole of another box, then the size of the picture when
    taken of the box was set to the size of the box hole.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a member of a robot team flipped over the remote control
    for the looks of the picture where the robots are working on the back then sometimes the
    robots got confused.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is now more robust if a robot destroys a picture it is on
    the back of.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 3/28 that incorrectly optimized
    pictures that have been erased and given a new appearance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sensor displays something that is not a picture (like
    the parts and container sensors) and the item is removed from the sensor it didn't behave
    as it should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a minor bug in the processing of the FileSearchPath
    entry in toontalk.ini.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made more improvements to how ToonTalk behaves if a robot on
    the back of a picture destroys the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of training a robot to work on a box
    containing a picture with robots running on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the remote control for the looks of a picture is stopped
    then the picture is stopped as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The size of the remote control for the looks of a destroyed
    picture was improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the reliability (but not accuracy) of dealing with
    objects that are smaller than a pixel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you select multiple files in the Windows can copy them to
    the clipboard, then ToonTalk got confused.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented (but have yet to decide whether this is a
    documented fully supported feature) control-i as a way to turn things into infinite stacks
    - very much like the stacks in Tooly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how ToonTalk behaves if a robot
    on the back of a picture destroys the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture is moving on top of another picture and is added
    to a notebook the picture no longer moves while in the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow Dusty and the Magic Wand to select subpictures of an
    infinite stack.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was suspended or turned off it now is activated if
    necessary if a box is dropped on it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots can now be trained to type labels for other robots.
    Also can be trained to add labels to birds or nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a running robot was vacuumed up and then the
    city saved, the robot would start to run inside of Dusty.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk handles running robots that are
    destroyed. Sometimes robots would still run after they should have been destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes Marty caused errors when describing why a robot
    stopped working.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a team of robots is destroyed while running
    (e.g. on the back of a picture that is destroyed) then some memory leaked.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk handles dropping something back on
    the stack it came from (or is identical to).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem putting force feedback effects into boxes.
    (Thanks to Ross for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes loading a joystick sensor. (Thanks
    to Ross for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes robots on the back of pictures stopped running when
    you picked up the picture - no longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented control-g which toggles whether you can grasp
    something with your hand - Dusty works in either case. Good for gluing things down to the
    floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot running elsewhere ended up on the back of
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the internal handling of flipped pictures on the
    back of other pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop something on top of a stack and something else
    and the stack &quot;rejects&quot; it then only sometimes did the other object get a chance
    to accept the drop (e.g. go into a hole in a box).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of objects whose size is less than a
    pixel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with matching force effects with force
    effects in a robot's thought bubble. (Thanks to Ross for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a similar problem for matching some kinds of sounds.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something went wrong while loading a city everything
    loaded prior to the problem is now added to the city.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the coordinates of objects saved in a
    city that are on the ground.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you saved a city while sitting on
    the ground, it didn't load back in properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when ToonTalk put up a dialog box to inform users
    of a serious problem the box was hidden under other windows.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes quitting after Dusty had erased things caused an
    error on exit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an error occurs while starting ToonTalk and you answer the
    dialog box saying you want to continue you no longer get more such dialog boxes.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk is told what language to use it now only checks
    the first few letters - e.g. &quot;port&quot; for Portuguese, &quot;eng&quot; for English,
    and &quot;swe&quot; or &quot;sve&quot; for Swedish.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If any section of a puzzle contained a line longer than 255
    characters, ToonTalk got confused. The limit is now 2048. (Thanks to Tiago for reporting
    this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty speaks while you are standing in a room, he is now
    a bit to the left so his talk balloon isn't clipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty is speaking with a general text-to-speech engine
    (one that doesn't need to spell unknown words) then the first talk balloon was displayed
    for much too long.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed other problems synchronizing Marty's speech and his
    talk balloons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle sequence ends in an HTML page (see 4/3 changes),
    then the default directory wasn't provided so it only worked reliably if a full path name
    was given.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you pick a demo, ToonTalk once again says &quot;OK&quot;</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the language is European Portuguese, then ToonTalk
    displays avenues with cardinals (e.g. 5) and not ordinals (e.g. Fifth).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer suggests you switch to a higher resolution
    when you have a high frame rate if you already have it set at 1024x768 or higher.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">For some screen resolutions (e.g. 1024x768) text pads got
    smaller as you typed more. (Thanks to Tiago for reporting this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes copying what is placed on the clipboard in a TT
    file on the ClippingDir (specified in your toontalk.ini file), misbehaved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="../English/ldbird.htm">Birds can now fly between computers</a>.
    Just put a bird on a clipboard and paste it into another machine. This is available in
    beta 23 and later. It is not ready for any product versions.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made major changes to how Marty speaks numbers in European
    Portuguese. (Thanks to Tiago for help here.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem adding pictures to a picture that is more
    than 1.5 times wider or taller than the screen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The nest of a long-distance bird can be copied or pasted (so
    long as it isn't pasted into another machine).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you exit ToonTalk after using long-distance birds,
    connections are released properly now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird flies to ToonTalk running on another
    computer and returns and then that ToonTalk is quit and restarted (and the nest was either
    saved in the city or pasted back in), then the bird will make a new connection and reach
    the nest again.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird is pasted into the same ToonTalk more
    than once, then each one shares the same connection to the nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird is given something and the computer
    where the nest isn't running ToonTalk, the bird will keep trying to connect.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird is pasted into the same ToonTalk as
    her nest, then the bird will fly directly to the nest and not fly through the network to
    the nest.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a long-distance bird receives lots of messages and can't
    deliver them just then, then she'll stop when the number of messages to deliver gets to be
    too many (currently around 50). And robots giving her things will also stop until the
    messages are delivered (e.g. because ToonTalk with the recipient nest was started).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced memory leak in the implementation
    of long-distance birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how Marty speaks numbers in
    European Portuguese.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how Marty speaks numbers in
    European Portuguese.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the nest of a long-distance bird is restored then you'll
    see an egg in the nest only if no local birds of this nest exist.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs in long-distance birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a computer has more than one IP address - e.g. a modem and
    local area network - a bird will try both to get to the nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was using a tool like the wand while you were out
    of the room sometimes when you returned the wand was huge.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/2</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements as to how ToonTalk handles very
    large things (bigger than the screen).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flipped over a picture (or number or text pad) and
    took out its remote control for its looks and flipped the looks over and put the original
    on its back and then flipped it back over, an error was signaled. It no longer causes and
    error and also Marty now warns you that strange things may happen (e.g. partial
    duplication of things on the back). Thanks to Tiago for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Warnings for loading a networked nest saved with a different
    IP addresses than the computer currently has now deals properly with multiple IP
    addresses.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Version 2.07 created (for release in Portugal).</font></li>

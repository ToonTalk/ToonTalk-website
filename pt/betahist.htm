<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>The History of ToonTalk Beta
Releases</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 20 mostly <a href="bugs.htm#Beta20">fixes many bugs and
adds some minor features</a>. Beta 20A fixes a few more bugs including one that made the
puzzle game nearly unplayable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 19 supports screen sizes of 800x600, 1024x768,
1152x864, 1280x1024, and 1600x1200. (Please let us know if some screen size you like is
missing.)&nbsp; You can select your screen size by clicking on 'Set Options' when starting
ToonTalk. 'Set Options' now also gives you a selection of text-to-speech voices if more
than one has been installed on your computer. Beta 19 also supports subtitles and closed
captioning. And <a href="bugs.htm#Beta18">bugs were fixed</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 18 now supports URLs wherever ToonTalk accepts file
names. For example, <a href="sensor.htm#PictureFile">the &quot;File to Picture&quot;
sensor</a> can now be given a URL like http://www.toontalk.com/ghost.bmp and it will
create a picture from that URL. URLs should work on <a href="command.htm">command line
options</a> specifying which city or puzzle or demo file you want ToonTalk to use. There
is a new command line option <a href="command.htm#SpokenLanguage">-spoken_language</a>
which enables you to specify you want ToonTalk text and talk balloons to be one language
while the spoken language is another language. You can now train robots to leave things on
the floor. A <a href="robot.htm">robot</a> will no longer automatically clean up things it
left on the floor if you ended its training while the robot was holding <a
href="dusty.htm">Dusty the Vacuum</a>. If you are running ToonTalk with a text-to-speech
engine that processes control tags they are no longer ignored. Tags can be inserted in the
text to change the pitch, speed, emphasis, etc of the speech. </font><font
face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">E.g</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="4">. </font><font
size="3">\Spd=360\ \Vce=Gender=&quot;Female&quot;\ which says the voice should change to a
speed of 360 and a female voice. Tags are ignored by some speech engines.</font> This
release should be able to run all of the games on <a
href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground/games.htm">the Playground Website</a>. And of course
<a href="bugs.htm#Beta17">more bugs were fixed</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 17 mostly <a href="bugs.htm#Beta16">fixes bugs</a> but
introduces a few enhancements. Now if you drop a nest on a nest, Bammer comes and smashes
them together. Birds of those nests now think that the resulting nest is theirs and will
deliver things there. This is a simpler and faster alternative than training a robot to
take things off of one nest and hand them a bird of the other nest. ToonTalk has always
had the convention that the space bar turns things on. Period or stop, '.', now turns
things off. This includes pictures, sounds, force effects, </font><font
face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">sensors, Dusty, Pumpy, and pictures. Pictures now can be
turned on (i.e. any robots on the back are activated) by pressing the space bar. Note that
this means you must use '+' and not space to cycle through different images or colors.</font><font
face="Comic Sans MS"> You can now have ToonTalk <a href="bugs.htm#CityFileMax">maintain
the last n versions</a> of the city in case you want to go back in time to a previous
saved state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 16 <a href="bugs.htm">fixes many bugs</a> particularly
those involving <a href="sensor.htm">picture sensors</a> needed for game programming. </font><font
face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">F4 now calls for the main notebook that lives inside of
Tooly. You can now save a city to the clipboard. Currently the only interface to this is
to sit on the ground outside and press control-c without holding anything in your hand. If
a city is on the clipboard when ToonTalk is started you'll start off in the clipboard
city. ToonTalk now supports Unicode so it can display all the alphabets of the world at
once. If the &quot;-language&quot; is Japanese this is enabled or if </font><font
face="Comic Sans MS">-unicode_code_page &lt;number&gt; is on the command line. For
example, -unicode_code_page 932 enables the Japanese code page so that you can cut and
paste Japanese text. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If ClippingDir=&lt;a
directory name&gt; in the Directories section of the toontalk.ini file then when ToonTalk
puts something on the clipboard it also puts a copy in a file in ClippingDir with the
users name (or if a city was put on the clipboard the users name followed by
&quot;_city&quot;).</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 15 introduces the ability to label nests and birds by
typing while holding them. You can also name a robot by typing while holding it. You can
associate comments with any object by pressing F8 to stop Marty (and all robots). You can
then give Marty something and he'll ask for something to associate with that object. If
you associate a text pad with an object then Marty will use that text when describing the
object. <a href="remote.htm">Several sensors</a> have been changed and some new ones
added. It now works to put a flipped over picture on the back of another flipped over
picture to give a picture a behavior. You can now use control-c to copy something to the
clipboard and control-v to paste it into ToonTalk. You can now control how many <a
href="command.htm">houses are on a block</a>. And <a href="bugs.htm">lots of bugs</a> have
been fixed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 14 <a href="bugs.htm#Beta14">mostly fixes bugs</a>. It
supports a new format for putting ToonTalk objects in the Windows clipboard. This new
format should be safe for sending through email. Beta 14 can read the old format as well
but Beta 13 cannot read ToonTalk objects saved by Beta 14 or later. Beta 14 also changes
the meaning of the visibility remote control for pictures. The setting &quot;SEE
SOME&quot; now make the background (black if a picture imported by a user) transparent.
And the setting &quot;SEE NOTHING&quot; no longer makes pictures that have been added to
the invisible picture invisible as well. Beta 14A <a href="bugs.htm#Beta14A">fixes several
bugs</a>. Beta 14B fixes <a href="bugs.htm#Beta14B">a few more bugs</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 13 gives you the ability to <a
href="robot.htm#ReTraining">re-train robots</a>. And more <a href="bugs.htm#Beta13">bugs
were fixed and small enhancements added</a>. Beta 13A fixes <a href="bugs.htm#Beta13A">a
few more bugs</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 12 adds a few features for very advanced users. Robots
can now be <a href="robot.htm#MetaProgramming">trained to manipulate teams of other robots</a>.
Thought bubbles can be edited and teams re-arranged. You can now arrange for any behavior
to happen when <a href="picture.htm#BirdOnTheBack">2 pictures collide</a>. Many bugs were
fixed and minor features have also been added. <a href="bugs.htm#Beta12">Click here</a>
for details.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 11 has two new features. ToonTalk now supports force
feedback joysticks. You can feel force effects when you use ToonTalk but you will also
find <a href="force.htm">a notebook of remote controls for using force effects</a> in your
own programs. There is now a way to load <a href="extend.htm">extensions into ToonTalk</a>.
The only extension currently defined enables you to read and write files and communication
ports from inside of ToonTalk. As always, <a href="bugs.htm#Beta11">various bugs</a> were
fixed as well. Beta 11A just <a href="bugs.htm#Beta11A">fixes several bugs</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 10 has updated and improved demos. And <a
href="bugs.htm#Beta10">lots of bugs fixed</a>. Beta 10A <a href="bugs.htm#Beta10A">fixes
even more bugs</a>. (Special thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting many of them.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 9 allows you to decorate houses (the roof and front
wall), rooms (the wall), and cities. All decoration can have robots on the back and so can
be given any behavior you like. You can now save cities. An automatic trouble-shooting
facility was added. You can now move around on the floor. You can now see what's on the
floor while standing in a room. A new options dialog was added to make it easier to
customize ToonTalk. And of course many <a href="bugs.htm#Beta9">bugs</a> were fixed. Beta
9A fixed <a href="bugs.htm#Beta9A">a few more bugs</a>. And Beta 9B fixed <a
href="bugs.htm#Beta9B">more bugs</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8 has support for combining &quot;behaviors&quot;. The
idea is that you can define a behavior (like chasing, bouncing, and exploding) as before
by placing robots on the back of a picture. Now you can combine behaviors by putting lots
of flipped pictures on the back of another picture. Check out these <a
href="programs.htm#Behaviors">examples of combining behavior.</a></font><font size="1"
face="Comic Sans MS"> </font><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8 also has many
&quot;synthetic&quot; pictures in the <i>Pictures </i>notebook now. In addition to the
rectangle that has been in ToonTalk for years, there are now ovals, rounded rectangles,
lines and more.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="bugs.htm#Beta8A">Beta 8A mostly fixes bugs</a> in
Beta 8.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8B adds 9 new puzzles, a much more robust Java applet
maker, and <a href="bugs.htm#Beta8B">some bug fixes</a>. It also uses a new much more
flexible installation program most of whose advantages are only on the CD-ROM version. The
removal of ToonTalk from your computer is now supported.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8C now supports joysticks -- but only the 32-bit
version of ToonTalk. You can use <a href="joystick.htm">a joystick to control the
programmer</a> as well as use <a href="joysense.htm">joystick sensors</a> to build games
that use the joystick. The way mouse buttons are used has changed. The right mouse button
now by default turns things on and off (like space bar), flips pages in notebooks, and
turns over pictures, numbers and text pads. The way <a href="sound.htm">sound effects</a>
are made and used has been changed as well. And <a href="bugs.htm#Beta8C">some bugs</a>
were fixed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Starting with version 6B there is now <a href="langs.htm">multi-lingual
support</a> and the ability to generate <a href="java.htm">Java applets</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now has a puzzle game starting with version 4C. You
can even <a href="make_pzl.htm">make your own puzzles</a>! </font></p>

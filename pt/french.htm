ToonTalk</font></strong></big></big></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nathalie Mathé has translated more than half of the
ToonTalk puzzles and everything that Marty says within the Puzzle Game. After you have
installed either the ToonTalk product (version 1.3 or earlier) or the trial version
(version 1.04 or earlier), download and run <a
href="ftp://ftp.toontalk.com/ftp/french.exe">french.exe</a> (about 1.3 MB), and it will
automatically add the needed files to your installation and change ToonTalk so it will by
default use French. If you have Beta 20 or later or a product version 1.3 or greater then
download <a href="ftp://ftp.toontalk.com/ftp/nfrench.exe">nfrench.exe</a> instead (about
.7 MB). (You cannot install the French extensions on top of a &quot;minimal&quot; install
from a CD-ROM.)&nbsp; Note, however, that only parts of the system are currently
translated so that with the exception of the Puzzle Game you'll see a combination of
French and English. You can restore things to use the previously installed language (e.g.
English) by clicking on 'Set Options' and changing the language option. (If you are
running a beta version you may need to switch the language back to the previous language
in order to run demos.) Unless you have <a href="tts.htm">a French text-to-speech engine</a>
installed on your machine you probably want to also use 'Set Options' so that Marty
doesn't speak when you are using the French extensions.</font></p>

<title>A satirical message about how to improve the ToonTalk environment:</title>
</head>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The following is a (satirical) message Eric
Scharff, a student in Wayne Citrin's class on Visual Programming at the University of
Colorado, sent to the class about how we might improve ToonTalk environment:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Subject:</b> Extending ToonTalk</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk provides an arcade world for the
fundamentals of computation, but perhaps it could benefit from a few additions that make
programming simpler.&nbsp; Here is one attempt at such an extension.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk introduced us to such memorable characters
as Marty the Martian, Tooly the tool chest, Dusty the vacuum cleaner, and Pumpy the
bicycle pump.&nbsp; While these tools provide a fun and complete programming world, some
additions to the ToonTalk family may ease the burden of producing games in this post-Pong
world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Our first new character is Dumpy, the garbage
truck.&nbsp; Dumpy performs garbage collection in the ToonTalk city. It's Dumpy's job to
remove the mess left by careless construction workers and robots that don't use
bombs.&nbsp; When the robots in a house stop performing a task, Dumpy forecloses on their
property.&nbsp; Soon, a wrecking ball arrives at the scene, demolishing the refuse created
by the idle tenants.&nbsp; Dumpy clears up the debris and returns the robots to you, as
the Mayor of ToonTalk doesn't allow homeless robots.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Some visual languages allow you to view your
programs at multiple levels of abstraction.&nbsp; In order to get more views on the
action, we can call on the services of Blurry the telescope.&nbsp; If we go up to the roof
with Blurry, we can spy on the computations in other houses.&nbsp; We can even zoom in and
out to see the progress of our neighborhood of systolic computations.&nbsp; However,
Blurry has some manners and will not allow you to look in on houses of robots who have
asked to be private.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Slowly the snail provides debugging and editing to
the ToonTalk players. Unlike many Americans, Slowly knows how to program and use a
VCR.&nbsp; One can hand robots and data to Slowly, who will eventually come back with a TV
and remote control.&nbsp; The user can then use the remote control to watch, rewind, fast
forward, or stop the group of robots.&nbsp; You can also insert new steps or delete
incorrect ones by updating the appropriate place in the recording.&nbsp; A special bird
will return the remote to you if it gets lost inside the ToonTalk couch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Slowly provides some of the functionality of
execution control, but we would also like inspection and breakpoints.&nbsp; Therefore, we
round out the cast of characters with Nosy, the nose.&nbsp; Nosy, the boss of all of the
robots and construction crews is ToonTalk's symbolic debugger.&nbsp; If you send Nosy with
your crews, he can sniff out specific variable states, robot actions,&nbsp; or other
conditions.&nbsp; If these conditions are met, Nosy will sneeze, startling the robots and
stopping execution.&nbsp; You may then fly over and see what Nosy was allergic to.&nbsp;
Nosy can also serve as a profiler, telling you how long the robots take to execute their
tasks and complaining to them that they should work harder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Unfortunately, many creatures wanted to enter the
ToonTalk world but were deemed unfit for various reasons.&nbsp; Folks like Pushy the stack
interface, Dicey the random number generator, and Formally the owl (the nit-picking
verification engine) may be useful additions to later versions of ToonTalk, but right now
we must crawl before we can walk.&nbsp; After we implement some state-of-the-art game
(like, say, Pole Position), we can think of our future goals for introducing new life into
the ToonTalk metropolis.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; We may need police officers soon!</font></p>

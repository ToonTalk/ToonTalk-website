  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><i>The protean nature of the computer is such that it can
  act like a machine or like a language to be shaped and exploited. It is a medium that can
  dynamically simulate the details of any other medium, including media that cannot exist
  physically. It is not a tool, although it can act like many tools. It is the first
  metamedium, and as such it has degrees of freedom for representation and expression never
  before encountered and as yet barely investigated. Even more important, it is fun, and
  therefore intrinsically worth doing.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><i>... Computers are to computing as instruments are to
  music. Software is the score, whose interpretation amplifies our reach and lifts our
  spirit. Leonardo da Vinci called music ``the shaping of the invisible,'' and his phrase is
  even more apt as a description of software.</i> </font></p>

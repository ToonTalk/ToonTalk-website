<div class="mainbody">
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">My story of Guess my Robot</h1>
  <p>Which sequences did you post? <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  Which sequences did you try to solve? Which did you succeed in solving and 
  which not? Try to explain why you could solve some and not others?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  When solving a sequence, did you manage to train a robot to generate it? If 
  not, why not? If yes, what did training the robot teach you about the 
  sequence?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  What interesting responses did you receive to your sequences or comments? Why 
  did you find them interesting?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Think of something special or surprising that happened to you during the game.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">What I liked about Guess my Robot</h1>
  <p>What are the things you liked most about the game? Why?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">What I didn't like</h1>
  <p>What do you think could be improved, and how?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Was&nbsp;anything about the game unclear or confusing? If yes, what, and how could 
  it be improved?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Did you encounter any technical difficulties? Give examples, and explain you 
  how overcame them.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">The Mathematics of Guess my Robot</h1>
  <p><br>
    Give an example of a sequence you found interesting. Explain what was 
  interesting about it.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Give an example of an &quot;easy&quot; sequence.&nbsp; What makes it easy?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Give an example of a &quot;hard&quot; sequence. What makes it hard?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  When playing guess my robot, did you try to solve the &quot;easy&quot; or the &quot;hard&quot; sequences? Why?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Was the mathematics of the game challenging?&nbsp; Is that good or bad? Try to 
  convince someone who thinks otherwise.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Does programming in ToonTalk change the kind of mathematics you do? In what 
  way?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  What did you learn from interacting with other players?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Did others solve the same sequences as you did, but differently? What did you 
  think when that happened?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">Guess my Robot and Learning</h1>
  <p>List 1-3 things you learnt from this game.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Do you think that Guess my Robot is a good way to learn about sequences? Why / 
  Why not?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  How could the game be improved, to make it ...<br>
  - More interesting<br>
  - More exciting<br>
  - More challenging<br>
  - Offer more opportunities for exploring mathematics<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  In what ways is Guess my Robot related to the Mathematics you learn at school?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">General comments</h1>
  <p>Anything else you would like to tell us (researchers, teachers, fellow 
  players):<br>
  <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="paragraphheading">Invent your own game</h1>
  <p>Propose a game of your own, that uses ToonTalk and web reports, and can 
  help players learn Mathematics.<br>

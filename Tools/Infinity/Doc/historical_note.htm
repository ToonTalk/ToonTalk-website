  <p class="parasubheading">Historical Notes on Cardinality</font></strong></p>
  <p>
    <span class="mainbody">  In the 9<sup>th</sup> century the star 
  worshipper and mathematician Thabit ibn Qurra, born in 826 in Harran, 
  Mesopotamia (now Turkey), argued that <b>infinity could be split into two, 
  three, or any number of parts, each of which would then have the same size as 
  the whole</b>: there is for example, an infinite number of evens, but also of 
  odds, so each half of infinity is infinity, and so on.</span></p>
  <p>
    <span class="mainbody"> In 1638 Galileo argued that “equal”, 
  “greater” and “less” can’t apply to infinite quantities because a line segment 
  contains an infinity of points, so a longer segment should contain more than 
  that infinity, which is impossible. And again, each natural number has its 
  square matched with it:</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
  
  <img src="../Nat_squares.GIF" width="347" height="96"></font></p>
  <p align="left">
    <span class="mainbody">Therefore there must be exactly as many 
  square numbers as there are naturals. But at the sametime they should be fewer 
  since </span><span class="mainbodyitalic"><i>the squares grow ever sparser as you go along</i>…</font></span></p>
  <p class="mainbody">Putting the question aside for a long 
    time seemed to be the best way of coping with it.</font></p>
    <span class="mainbody">The first one who revolutionized our 
  understanding of the infinite was the German mathematician Georg Cantor 
  (1845-1918). He introduced several basic notions<i>: set</i> and <i>
  cardinality</i> <i>of a set.</i></font></span></p>
  <p >
    <span class="mainbody">The cardinality of the set {rabbit, fox, 
  wolf } is 3, and so is the cardinality of the set [-25, 30 180] because there 
  is 1-1 correspondence between the elements of these sets:</font></span></p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center">
    <span class="mainbody">Rabbit </font>    «-25</font></span></p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="mainbody">Fox </font>
30</font></font></span></p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="mainbody">Wolf </font>    « 180</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
    <span class="mainbody">What about infinite sets? We could 
  establish 1-1 correspondence between the natural and the even numbers, viz. 
  each natural is perfectly matched with its double:</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
  
  <img src="../Nat_Even.gif" width="347" height="96"></font>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center">&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
  To say that these matchings-up show that 
  there are as many of one kind as of the other needs, of course, a very bold 
  leap of thought. We are taking each sort as a completed whole: <b>all the 
  naturals</b> match up perfectly with <b>all the evens</b> (or with all the 
  odds). Stop short and the correspondence breaks down e.g. there are only 50 
  evens among the first 100 naturals. The multiples of 3 are even <i>thinner</i> 
  on the ground than those of 2 and still, there are as many of them as of the 
  naturals (they are selected from):</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
  
  <img src="../Nat_3N.GIF" width="347" height="96"></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
  More generally: for any natural number
      <i>m</i>, there are just as many multiples of <i>m </i>as there are natural 
  numbers:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
  
  <img src="../Nat_nm.GIF" width="347" height="96"></font></p>
  <p>
  <span class="mainbody">If you ask:</font></span> <i class="mainbodyitalic">how many is that? </i><span class="mainbody">we 
  could say:</span> <span class="mainbodyitalic"><i>the set <b>N</b> of the natural numbers and the set <b>mN</b> of 
  the multiples of m <b>have the same cardinality</b>, as established by 1-1 
  correspondence we made</i></span><i>. </i><span class="mainbody">Since we count by means of the natural numbers, we 
  could also say that both sets are <b><i>countable</i></b>.</font></span></p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
  The crucial ideas in mathematic are 
  always so simple as to seem intuitively clear: <b>sets and making 1-1 
  correspondences between their members</b>. You needn’t even know how to count 
  to do this. In the 4th century a nomadic army from the East rode 
  through the Caucasus into Armenia. “No one could number the vastness of the 
  cavalry contingents” wrote a contemporary chronicler. “So every man was 
  ordered to carry a stone so as to throw it down… so as to form a mound…And 
  wherever they passed, they left such markers at every crossroad along their 
  way.” During some battles the soldiers would set down a stone and those who 
  survived would take each his stone back home.</font></p>
  <p class="mainbody">
  An 1-1 correspondence between the 
  members of the sets might be hard to find, but once revealed, the two sets 
  between which it ran had to have the same cardinality. Conversely, if somehow 
  you proved that no 1-1 correspondence could exist between the members of two 
  sets, then their cardinalities would have to be different.</font></p>
  
  <p class="mainbody">Having found that any 
  infinity sequence of the naturals is countable (not a great surprise as it 
  first seemed, if you think about it, since such a sequence will have a first 
  term, then a second, third and so on – and ordering them thus in effect counts 
  them), we could look in the opposite direction – at a set that includes the 
  natural numbers, viz. the set Z of integers (naturals, 0 and negatives whole 
  numbers). Is it possible to put this set too in 1-1 correspondence with its 
  subset N?</p>
  <p class="mainbody">Yes, but with a little bit of 
  imagination, <span style='mso-ignore:vglayout;position:
absolute;z-index:1;left:504px;top:222px;width:19px;height:12px'><img width=19
height=12 src="historical_note_files/image001.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_s1025"></span>a possible match up would 
  be the following one:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt" align="center">
  <img src="../Nat_Int.GIF" width="212" height="96"></p>
  <p class="mainbody">This shows that the integers 
  have the same cardinality as the naturals.</p>
  <p class="mainbody">What about the rational 
  numbers – isn’t it obvious that they should be more than the integers and thus 
  – forming a <i>more powerful</i> infinity?.. After all between any two 
  fractions will lie another whereas you could always tell the neighbors of any 
  integer. In other words, any set as numerous as the naturals is countable, but 
  how could you possibly count the positive rationals? It look as if you cant’ 
  even start – between 0 and any candidate you name, another will appear… 
  Clearly an order from smaller to larger is not possible because of the 
  ceaseless in-betweens. But&nbsp; Cantor looked at the fractions from another angle:</p>
  <p align="center">
  <img src="../Nat_Frac.gif" width="314" height="321"></p>
  <p class="mainbody">Let us start from the 
  upper-left corner. To continue horizontally or vertically would leave “vast 
  quantity” of fractions untouched. So Cantor decided to “travel all over them 
  in zigzag along diagonals” mode. Following the arrows you could put into 1-1 
  correspondence all the positive rationals with the natural numbers. Of course 
  some fractions will appear more than once, but we can easily get rid of the 
  duplicates. Thus a possible 1-1 correspondence is the following one:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../Nat_rational112794.GIF" width="212" height="96"></p>
  <p class="mainbody">This strange sequence of 
  rational numbers makes sense only when you see its 2D source, and what it 
  shows is that the set of positive rationals contains no larger infinity than 
  the infinity of the natural numbers.</p>
  <p><span class="mainbody">Or, we could say that</span> <span class="mainbodybold">“<b>how 
  many” has nothing to do with “how dense</b>”!</span></p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">What did Cantor achieve? He 
  matched up the members of the set N of the natural numbers with the members of 
  the set Z of the integers, and then – with the members of the set of the 
  rational numbers. Thanks to the notions “set” and “1-1 correspondence” the 
  notion of “infinity” had not many vague meanings but one. The next candidate 
  for a set with a bigger cardinality than the natural numbers was the set R of 
  the real numbers. Cantor managed to show that there was no 1-1 correspondence 
  between the sets N and R by a proof of contradiction. Namely, he assumed that 
  the real numbers in the interval (0,1) are countable, i.e. they could be 
  arranged in a sequence as follows:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
    <span class="mainbody">0.a<sub>11</sub> a<sub>12</sub> a<sub>13</sub>…</span></p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
  0.a<sub>21</sub> a<sub>22</sub> a<sub>23</sub>…</p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
  0.a<sub>31</sub> a<sub>32</sub> a<sub>33</sub>…</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
    <span class="mainbody">…</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">    <span class="mainbody">…</span></p>
  <p class="mainbody">If the assumption that the 
  set of the real numbers in the interval (0,1) is countable, every real number 
  in the interval (0, 1) should be somewhere in this list. Here is how Cantor 
  constructed his great counterexample. The first decimal place in the first 
  number of the above sequence is a<sub>11, </sub>which is between 0 and 9. 
  Cantor asks us to construct a number as follows. It begins with 0, but the 
  first decimal place would depend on a<sub>11 </sub>– we put any digit 
  different from a<sub>11. </sub>On the second decimal palce we put any digit 
  different from a<sub>22</sub>, and so on – for every <i>n</i> 
  we construct the <i>n</i>-th decimal place of our number to be <i>different</i> 
  from a<i><sub>nn.</sub></i> Notice that the number we constructed 
  according to this <i>diagonal method</i> cannot be found on our list – it 
  could not be on the first term of our sequence, since it differs from it at 
  least in its first decimal place; it could not be the second term because at 
  least its second decimal place is different; nor the third, nort the forth, 
  nor the <i>n</i>-th for similar reasons. In fact, it cannot be anywhere on 
  this list which was assumed to contain all the reals in (0, 1) because it 
  differs from each term of the above sequence in at least one decimal place. 
  Thus our assumption that the set of the real numbers in the interval (0,1) is 
  countable&nbsp;lead to a contradiction!</p>
  <p class="mainbody">This simple and elegant proof 
  open the gates to what Hilbert called the <i>Cantor Paradise</i>.&nbsp;A set whose 
  cardinality was larger than that of the natural numbers&nbsp; was found! In other 
  words – there exist infinites of different size!</p>
  <p class="mainbody">By such striking insights 
  Cantor faced the challenge of authorities like Aristotle, Gauss and Kronecker 
  who said that it was illegitimate to deal with completed (not potential) 
  infinities. By making infinity <i>actual, </i>Cantor redefined the notion of “number” in terms of sets and so laid the foundations of modern mathematics.</p>

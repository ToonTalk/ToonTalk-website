<h1 class="paragraphheading">Pedagogical advice: Lunar Lander</h1>
<div>
  <ul>
      <li class="mainbody">Students need to work with three different systems during these 
      activities: ToonTalk for modelling and recording data and Excel for plotting 
      data (note there is a <a href="excel_tutorial.htm">tutorial here</a>). 
      Experience from last year has shown that although students will have initial 
      difficulty, they quickly become conversant in using all three systems for 
      the tasks at hand.</li>
      </ul>
  <ul>
        <li class="mainbody">Students will not have much experience or good understandings of 
          position-time graphs. The idea should be introduced with reference to common 
          position-time graphs such as daily temperature readings. The idea of <i>
          sampling</i> also needs to be introduced i.e. how frequently data is 
          recorded. An analogy can be made to monthly, daily or hourly temperature 
          readings. Technically the sampling in ToonTalk is a bit tricky - it is &quot;as 
          fast as possible&quot; and is therefore variable depending on the computer and 
          processing load etc. However, you can explain that it is &quot;very fast&quot; e.g. 
          50 times per second. The important concept to get across is that each data 
          point represents a value at a particular time, and that <i>elapsed time 
          increases as you travel along the position-time graph to the right</i>. You 
          will need to reiterate this point - keep asking students &quot;what does this 
          axis represent?&quot; or similar.</li>
        </ul>
  <ul>
          <li class="mainbody">Students will have difficulty with the concept of <i>acceleration</i>.&nbsp; 
            It is a difficult concept. Students will get confused between speed (or 
            velocity) and acceleration. They might say that a moving object is 
            accelerating. They are also likely to say that acceleration is &quot;speeding up&quot; and not recognise it as also slowing down (well, this is confusing anyway - 
            we also use the term <i>deceleration </i>for slowing down, but in a physics 
            sense acceleration means <i>change in speed</i> whether &quot;speeding up&quot; or 
    &quot;slowing down&quot;). You should reiterate that <i>acceleration is a change in 
          speed (velocity)</i>. </li>
        </ul>
  <ul>
          <li class="mainbody">You should explain to students that if they <i>scroll</i> while 
              recording data then they will cause a discontinuity on a position-time graph 
              because the position sensors are <i>relative </i>to the programmer's 
              position (so they should avoid scrolling if possible). You can show an 
              example of this. Also ask students questions about the relationship between 
              the top and bottom of the screen, and what this relates to on a 
          position-time graph. </li>
        </ul>
  <ul>
          <li class="mainbody">Using F8 to start and stop all robots is an effective way to control the 
                recording of data. E.g. turn off power (F8), set the relevant position, 
                speed, and acceleration sensors/ tools to what you want, give the Export to 
                Excel tool the sensor you want to record, then turn power on (F8) to start 
          recording data and again F8 to stop when finished. </li>
        </ul>
  <ul>
    <li class="mainbody">You should also instruct students to simply delete (i.e. suck up with 
                  Dusty) each Excel tool once it has been used once (and take a new one from 
                  the notebook). This is because if more than one Excel tool is running, you 
                  will get unpredictable results as both are trying to copy to the clipboard. 
                  Also, occasionally kids switch into Excel and then accidentally press &quot;ctrl-c&quot; before pressing &quot;ctrl-v&quot; which has the effect of clearing the 
                  clipboard, meaning the data just recorded in ToonTalk will be lost.</li>
  </ul>

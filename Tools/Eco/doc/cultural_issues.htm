<p class="paragraphheading">Cultural issues with Randomness Activity Sequence</p>
<div class="stx">
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody">During the 
  first experimentation of the Randomness activity sequence two main cultural 
  and contextual issues raised. The first issue concerns pupils’ tendency to 
  reject randomness as a pursuable strategy for problem solving; the second 
  issue concerns teacher’s resistance to accept the production by the class of 
  partial encyclopaedia documents. In the following we are going to focus mainly 
  on the first issues, and will conclude by adding a few details concerning the 
  latter.<O:P></O:P></span><O:P></O:P></p>
  <p><span class="parasubheading">Can randomness be a pursuable strategy?<O:P></O:P></span></p>
  <O:P></O:P>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody">Some of 
  the activities within the Randomness activity sequence aim at developing 
  random strategies for problem solving. In particular we propose to pupils two 
  similar games, based on the same device, the LEGO RCX robot ShakerBot. In the 
  two games pupils are required to drive the ShakerBot, in the first game the 
  goal is to drive it over certain targets in order to score points, while in 
  the second game the goal is to drive the robot over as many black spots as 
  possible. In the first case the best strategy is to point targets and drive 
  the robot toward them on purpose; in the second case, to drive the robot upon 
  black spots on purpose is very difficult (but still possible) and a random 
  strategy may turn out to be the winning one, or at least a good one. In fact, 
  due to the properties of random walks (in an infinite time a random walk 
  covers all the available space), it may be the case that just by driving the 
  ShakerBot randomly one walks upon many black spots, thus scoring many points. 
  Of course, it is also a matter of available time, and of luck, however the 
  random strategy can be a good strategy for such a game. According to our 
  plans, the two games should foster the idea that it is possible to follow 
  random strategies (as opposed to non random ones), and the idea that random 
  strategies can be good for solving some specific problems.
        <O:P></O:P></span><O:P></O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody">When we 
  set up the two games in our first experimentation, we could observe that in 
  both games some pupils scored many points just by driving the ShakerBot 
  randomly, and in particular in the second game some of the highest scores were 
  obtained following a random (or semi-random) strategy. However this didn’t 
  seem to result in pupils accepting random strategies as good ones and pupils 
  didn’t seem to give to random strategies the same status of deterministic 
  strategies. This was suggested by pupils’ reports, and made clearer by a set 
  of interviews that we conducted a week after pupils had played the second 
  game. In general we individuated three main trends within the groups of pupils 
  rejecting randomness as a good strategy for the ShakerBot games, that can be 
  synthesized as follows:<O:P></O:P></span><O:P></O:P></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
    <span class="mainbody">1<span lang="EN-GB">.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>  <span class="mainbody"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Pupils not ascribing any good property to the 
  random strategy</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">: they do not believe that it is 
  possible to score many points by driving the ShakerBot randomly. Some of these 
  pupils were asked, when interviewed, to play the second game twice, once using 
  their own strategy, and the other time going randomly; the obtained results 
  contrasted with their opinions (in fact the random strategy led them to score 
  more points then their own strategies), resulting, for some of them, in a 
  slight change of opinion towards the trends described below.
  <O:P></O:P>
  </span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody">

  score many points driving the ShakerBot randomly, but they wouldn’t adopt such 
  a strategy because “it is only a matter of luck”</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">.<O:P></O:P></span></span></p>

    <span class="mainbody" lang="EN-GB">Some pupils recognize that it is possible to score 
  many points driving the ShakerBot randomly, but they wouldn’t adopt such a 
  strategy because it is less interesting/fun than a deterministic strategy. <O:P></O:P></span><span lang="EN-GB"><O:P></O:P></span><span lang="EN-GB"><O:P></O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody">In other 
  words, pupils may accept randomness as a good strategy, but would not adopt it. 
  We believe that such a position is the result of many possible factors, some of 
  them culturally rooted. Before the experiment, we had individuated 
  the following factors that were later supported also by the randomness related 
  examples brought by our pupils in the first phase. (The Randomness Small Talks 
  activities) of the experiment:</span><O:P></O:P></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 39pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody">
  1<span lang="EN-GB">.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>  <span class="mainbody"><i><span lang="EN-GB">A socially shared tendency towards determinism in 
  contrast to randomness</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">. We believe that in 
  general, randomness is considered to be less valuable then non randomness, as 
  shown also by the examples brought by our pupils, sometimes randomness has a 
  negative connotation. For instance in the phrase “I answered randomly to the 
  test because I had not studied”, randomness is associated to the socially 
  negative behaviour of not having studied.<O:P></O:P></span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 39pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody">
  2<span lang="EN-GB">.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>  <span class="mainbody"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Lack of experiences involving randomness as a 
  strategy</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">; in fact pupils previous experiences 
  concerning randomness consisted mainly in chance game situations, or in daily 
  life situations driven by loss of control or lack of information. In none of 
  the examples of randomness related situations brought by our pupils  can 
  we find random strategies. For instance a chance game (eg. Dices, bingo, etc.) is 
  based on some random phenomenon, but a player is never involved in choosing 
  between a random or non random strategy; in the same stream, also in daily 
  life situations like “I chose a jacket at random because they were all the same” (this is an example brought by pupils), the subject is not involved in 
  choosing between a random and a non random strategy. <O:P></O:P>
  </span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 39pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
    <span class="mainbody" lang="EN-GB">Such lack of experience can be individuated at a more 
  global social level, in the sense that if we exclude chance games, there are 
  really few examples in which randomness plays a key role, and even fewer 
  examples in which it is convenient to use randomness as a problem solving 
  strategy. Significant examples can be found in advanced sciences, but not in 
  daily life.<O:P></O:P></span></p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">One of the 
  aims of the ShakerBot activities was to overcome such factors, providing 
  pupils with a situation in which randomness could be individuated either as a
      <i>strategy</i> and as a <i>good strategy</i>. If on one side the first 
  objective was somehow reached, fostering the idea that one could adopt a 
  random strategy, the goal to give positive connotations to random strategies 
  was not reached.
      <O:P></O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="mainbody" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">A first 
  analysis of the data suggested to us some more possible factors that influenced 
  pupils behaviour:<O:P></O:P></p>
  <ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0cm" type="1">
    <li class="mainbody" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i><span lang="EN-GB">The 
    sense of “fun”</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">: driving the ShakerBot 
    randomly was not perceived as fun, because it was not under the control of 
    the user.
    <O:P></O:P>
    </span></li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody"><i><span lang="EN-GB">The 
    sense of “control”</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">: most of the pupils that 
    moved the ShakerBot randomly did it because they were unable to drive it non 
    randomly (in fact the device is designed to facilitate random strategies). 
    Some pupils switched to non random movements as soon as they were able to do 
    it, and some of them did not go back to random movements even if they had 
    scored more points when moving randomly. Perhaps pupils need to feel they 
    are controlling the object.<O:P></O:P></span></span> </li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody"><i><span lang="EN-GB">The 
    tasks proposed to pupils were too much oriented towards a deterministic 
    approach</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">: in fact pupils were required to 
    explain the functioning of the ShakerBot and how to drive it, we believe 
    that this shifted their attention, and the focus of the discussion, away 
    from the randomness issue.<O:P></O:P></span></span> </li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody"><i><span lang="EN-GB">The 
    proposed tasks did not highlight enough the good properties of random 
    strategies as opposed to non random strategies</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">: 
    for the next experimentations we plan to set up games, or situations, where 
    random strategies are much better then non random strategies.<O:P></O:P></span></span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="mainbody" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In 
  particular the latter two factors are supported by the final class discussion 
  aimed at updating the Randomness Encyclopaedia. Such a discussion was 
  structured by the teacher (under our advice) as a review of the past 
  activities, each example episode, or object encountered during the activity 
  sequence was discussed in terms of its randomness related properties. In 
  particular items where classified in terms of their randomness/non-randomness 
  and predictability/unpredictability in order to insert them as new elements of 
  the corresponding Encyclopaedia items “random”, “non random”, “predictable”, 
  “unpredictable”. The final part of the discussion is quite interesting for 
  what concerns the issue of negative/positive connotations of random 
  strategies. After pupils have discussed the case of the Sweeper Bot, and had 
  agreed that if it is left alone moving, after a while it will have covered 
  all the available space, the teacher poses the following question:<O:P></O:P></p>

  resistance to accept randomness as a good strategy, or simply she doesn’t

  case of a total lack of information. At this point the teacher tries to push 
  the discussion towards the idea that random strategies not only can be good 
  when one doesn’t have enough information to solve a problem; in fact in some 
  cases randomness can be a very good strategy to generalize a solution to a 
  problem, in particular for problems where some crucial information remains 
  unknown. For instance, suppose we want to program a robot that is able to 
  paint (or to sweep) a figure, no matter what the topology and the shape of the 
  figure is. Thus the teacher proposes: <O:P></O:P>

  <p class="mainbody" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The 
  teacher’s observation moves the focus of the discussion towards a 
  generalisation of the problem of cleaning a house, the new problem now is to 
  be able to clean up any house. As a result of such generalisation, the class 
  produced the following excert of Randomness Encyclopaedia item “random”:<O:P></O:P></p>

  this episode is interesting because on one side it shows pupils resistance to 
  accept randomness as a good strategy, but on the other side it shows that it 
  is possible to overcome such a resistance setting up suitable activities that 
  put pupils in front of situations where randomness is actually a feasible 
  strategy, and a very good one. In this particular case a key role has been 
  played by the tangibles Sweaper Bot and “briciola” (the robot inthe TV 
  advertisement); they served to focus the class discussion on the teachers 
  educational goal, providing sources for a rich discussion concerning 
  randomness, on the basis of their observable functioning, and their 
  programmability (actual or supposed). Finally, we observe that if on one side 
  experiences (direct or indirect ones) with the robots brought sources for 
  discussion, on the other side, it is thanks to the class discussion aimed at 
  updating the encyclopaedia that we could observe an evolution of pupils ideas 
  concerning randomness and its usability and validity as a strategy for 
  problem solving.<O:P></O:P></span><span lang="EN-GB"><O:P></O:P></span><span lang="EN-GB"><O:P></O:P></span></p>

  <p class="mainbody" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In the 
  episode presented above a key role is played by the Randomness Weblabspaedia, 
  and in particular by the activity of updating such an encyclopaedia. Such an 
  activity can be exploited by the teacher in order to stimulate class 
  discussions and direct them towards the construction of items of the 
  encyclopaedia that are the result of an agreement between pupils and of their 
  collective reflection. In the particular episode the activity of updating the 
  encyclopaedia was exploited as a means for discussing randomness as a strategy 
  for problem solving, and it lead to overcoming pupils resistance to accept 
  that a random strategy can be a good one. The agreement reached by the pupils 
  is crystallized in the extract of the Encyclopaedia item “random”, as 
  reported above. At this stage the encyclopaedia has been updated only by 
  appending new stuff to the existent items, without discussing its previously 
  included contents, and without checking the coherence of new contents with the 
  rest of the encyclopaedia. <O:P></O:P>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span class="mainbody" lang="EN-GB">However, 
  the teacher plans to set up a new revision at the beginning of the next school 
  year, in order to systematize it and eventually change its contents. The fact 
  that the teacher herself plans to set up such a revision is to considered as a 
  result of the experiment, in the sense that at the beginning of the activity 
  sequence we witnessed strong resistances from her side with respect to the 
  idea of publishing encyclopaedia items that were not “perfect”. In fact in the 
  first phases of the experimentation, we received from the teacher in several 
  occasions, requests to not publish reports collectively produced by the 
  pupils, the reasons for such a request were expressed in phrases like:<O:P></O:P></span><span lang="EN-GB"><O:P></O:P></span><span lang="EN-GB"><O:P></O:P></span></p>

  of the number of activities aimed at producing collective reports (like those 
  of the Randomness Weblabspaedia). Our interpretation of this phenomenon is 
  that there is a resistance of the teacher with respect to the idea of 
  publishing documents that are not “perfect” or “definitive”, possible social

  <p class="mainbody" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Besides 
  such social factors, we want to observe that for this experiment, it was 
  crucial that the idea of publishing “unfinished” works, in the sense that 
  Encyclopaedia items were supposed to represent the evolving culture of the 
  class; it was one of our educational goals that of introducing pupils to the 
  idea that culture can be socially built and shared, and that, even in science, 
  it is important to fix and publish for the community also non definitive 
  results. We hypothesize that this educational goal contrasted to the usual 
  scholastic tendency to consider valuable and publishable only correct and 
  finished works. In other words, for us it was important that the process of 
  producing and updating the encyclopaedia, and this we believe contrasts with the 
  usual scholastic tendency to consider the final product as the most important 
  thing. Thus our interpretation of the witnessed phenomenon is that probably at 
  the beginning the teacher regarded at the Encyclopaedia mainly as a final result, 
  with no particular attention to the process leading to its production. 
  Nevertheless the teacher put a lot of effort in all the activities, included 
  collective discussions and the production of collective reports, and we 
  assisted to an evolution of her behaviour, leading to the last Encyclopaedia 
  update activity that we partially mentioned in the episode described above. 
  The fact that at the end she asks us to publish Encyclopaedia items that she 
  already knows  are not going to be definitive, is a clear sign of an 
  evolution toward our ideas of Encyclopaedia interpreted as an entity that 
  evolves together with the class culture.<O:P></O:P></p>
  <p><span class="mainbodyitalic" lang="EN-GB">
  We believe this learning snapshot, which involves mainly the teacher, is 
  important for the project because it shows possible difficulties related to the 
  use of an information sharing system like the phone. When we set up 
  experiments that involve teachers that are immersed in the school context, it 
  is important to take into account  the kind of resistance to publishing non 
  definitive documents that we described in this section.</span><br>

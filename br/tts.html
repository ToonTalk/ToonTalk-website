<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ToonTalk CD-ROM includes and automatically installs a
text-to-speech engine so that <a href="marty.htm">Marty</a> can speak. It is also used by <a
href="sensor.htm#TextToSpeech">the text-to-speech sensor</a> so you can use text-to-speech
in your own ToonTalk programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you would like to try ToonTalk with another speech engine
or you downloaded the beta version of ToonTalk, you can <a
href="http://microsoft.com/iit/documentation/license.htm">download a free text-to-speech
engine from Microsoft</a>. You'll then need to select 'Set Options' next time to run
ToonTalk and select the voice you wish to hear. (You won't see an option if only 1 voice
is installed.) This works only in ToonTalk version 1.1 or Beta 19 or later.<br>
<br>
Please report any problems.</font></p>

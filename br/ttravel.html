<p align="center"><big><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time Travel in ToonTalk for
Undo, Instant Replay, and better Demos</font></strong></big></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Starting with Beta 21 (or version 2.0) you can use time
travel while using ToonTalk. Time travel enables you to pause ToonTalk and then go back in
time either for an instant replay or to take over and do things differently (a kind of
undo ability). </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">For the time being, time travel <em>is not enabled by
default</em>. This is because it consumes disk space and may introduce new bugs. To enable
it, edit your toontalk.ini file to have entries for GenerateLogs and SecondsBetweenLogs in
the Switches section. For example, GenerateLogs=100 and SecondsBetweenLogs=5 will enable
time travel where you can travel in time in 5 second increments and the furthest you can
travel back in time is 500 seconds (5x100). Note that sometimes ToonTalk is doing
something that can't be interrupted so some segments will be greater than 5 seconds in
practice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When time travel is enabled the only difference is what
happens when you press the <em>Pause</em> button on the keyboard. You'll see controls like
those for a VCR appear. (The following picture will be redone with the right color
palette.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The numbers underneath show the segment number
and the date and time it began. The first button jumps to the oldest segment. The '&lt;'
button jumps back one segment. The next button does stops replay (only if the 'GO' button
has been pressed to&nbsp; start replay). The '&gt;' button jumps forward one segment if
you have gone back in time already. The '&gt;&gt;' button jumps to the newest segment. If
you have pressed 'GO' then the 'X' button removes the buttons but continues to show the
replay. (Displaying the buttons does slow down the replay.) If the 'GO' button hasn't been
pressed then the 'X' button removes the buttons and resumes ToonTalk from the current
place in time. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you add &quot;-resume 1&quot; to the command
line of your ToonTalk icon or Start Menu item, then ToonTalk will start where you last
left off. As you resume where you left off you will be adding segments to your time travel
record. (This will have a better interface soon.)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="../bird.gif" alt="A Picture of a bird" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="158"></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Briefly you can copy a bird to the clipboard (e.g. using
control-c) and then paste it (e.g. using control-v) into an email, chat, instant message,
web page, or floppy so that it ends up on another computer running ToonTalk. If you give
the bird something and the other computer is still running ToonTalk and there is a network
(and no fire walls or the like in-between) then it should arrive on the nest on the other
computer. If the other computer starts running ToonTalk before you quit your ToonTalk then
the message will be delivered soon afterwards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The nest can be saved (e.g. in a city) on one computer and
the bird on another and the connection will be reestablished when both systems are running
and the bird and nest are recreated. Currently this will not work if the computer with the
nest as a different Internet address (IP) than when it was created. The bird can be
recreated on a different computer or even on multiple other computers and all the birds
will fly to the same nest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can also load the bird and nest into the same ToonTalk
on the same computer and the connection will be established and work without using the
network. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want to copy a bird to the clipboard without making
it network capable you'll need to copy the bird's nest at the same time. E.g. put them
both in a box before copying to the clipboard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can edit your <a href="ttini.htm#LogNetworkEvents">toontalk.ini</a>
file to produce a detail log of long-distance bird activities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Future enhancements will enable nests to be relocated or
copied. And messages to be sent even if both computers aren't running at the same time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Requires Beta 23 or Beta 250400 or later. It also requires <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">DirectX 7</a> or later or for NT 4 you'll need
service pack 6 or higher. </font></p>

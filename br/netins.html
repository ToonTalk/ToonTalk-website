Networked Server</big></big></font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, the product CD-ROM installation script works
only under very special conditions when it is installed on a network. The following is
more complicated than it should be but it works.</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy the entire CD-ROM to the server on the directory of your
    choice. (You'll be able to delete much of it on the final step below.) Note if you later
    move these files to a different directory, you'll need to repeat this entire procedure.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Replace the setup.ins file in the Install directory with <a
    href="ftp://ftp.toontalk.com/ftp/setup.ins">a new version that you can download from the
    web site</a>. It should be about 71 KB.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to each computer that will run ToonTalk and run
    install\setup.exe from the network directory you chose in step 1. If you have a fast
    network, you should be able to choose the &quot;Compact&quot; option and still get good
    performance. Otherwise, you'll want to install parts of ToonTalk on the local disks using
    either the &quot;Typical Install&quot; or the &quot;Custom Install&quot; option.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now safely delete all the directories and files
    EXCEPT the ToonTalk directory (about 141 MB) from the network server.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you also would like the ToonTalk Users directory to be on
the network server, you'll have to edit the toontalk.ini file on the Windows directory of
each local machine. The &quot;Directories&quot; entry for &quot;MainDir&quot; should be
the networked directory. It should look the same as the &quot;CDROMdir&quot; entry if you
installed things following the steps listed above.</font></p>

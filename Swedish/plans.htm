		<p align="center"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" style="font-size: larger">Enhancements in</font></strong><big><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS"> ToonTalk Version 3<br>
					</font><font size="1" face="Comic Sans MS">(ej &ouml;versatt till svenska)</font></strong></big></p>
		<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk version 3 includes these improvements over version 2:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Arbitrarily large integers and exact rational arithmetic.</strong> The size of numbers in ToonTalk 3 is only limited only by the amount of memory available. Numbers with millions of digits are possible. Exact fractional values are&nbsp;also supported. These numbers can be spoken as well. <a href="newnum.htm">Click here</a> for details.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Time travel.</strong> This is a way to move back and forward in time while using ToonTalk. It provides a new way of replaying some actions, undoing mistakes and making enhanced demos.&nbsp; <a href="ttravel.htm">An experimental implementation</a> of this is in version 2 but there are situations where it didn't work reliably.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Full 32-bit color.</strong> ToonTalk 2 reduces every picture to a palette of 256 colors. You can run ToonTalk 3 at any color depth. Both the built-in artwork and your imported images will look better.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>A new HTML-based interface for all dialogs.</strong> The new dialogs look nicer and are more flexible. Perhaps most importantly, administrators (e.g. teachers, parents, museum curators) can add or remove available options using any HTML editor.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Incorporation of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msagent">Microsoft Agent</a> into the documentation and dialog screens.</strong> Animated help characters who speak will be optionally available to help users with dialog screens and on-line documentation.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>XML-based format for saving and loading ToonTalk objects.</strong> For advanced users this provides a way to make global changes to their creations. It will also support the creation of new ToonTalk tools by third parties.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Automatic packaging of user images and sounds when saving and loading ToonTalk objects.</b> Users can bring pictures and sounds into ToonTalk and easily export games and applications using this media without worry about file names, packaging, or compression.</font>
			<li><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ability to edit text and labels using arrow keys.</font></b>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Ability to edit pictures. </b>Users with two clicks run their favorite picture editor on something they are holding in ToonTalk. The edited picture is automatically brought into ToonTalk.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Full support for tablet PCs and touch screens.</strong> Version 3 supports an interface using a tablet or touch panel without using a mouse or other pointing device.</font>
			<li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Plus hundreds of other enhancements.</strong> Perhaps as important as the major enhancements listed above are the hundreds of smaller enhancements that make ToonTalk 3 easier to use and learn.</font>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk 3 also includes the learning material developed by the European <a href="weblabs_project.htm">WebLabs Project </a>and games and game components created by the European <a href="playgrnd.htm">Playground Project</a>.</font></p>

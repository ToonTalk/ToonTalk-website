<p>You can customize ToonTalk so that all new users begin as &quot;copies&quot; of a user 
you have created. You can create a user and customize things, change 
the main notebook, or save the city and everyone will start off with those 
changes.</p>

<p>There are two ways of telling ToonTalk about the default user:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adding an entry to toontalk.ini. If you set
  <a href="ttini.htm#DefaultUser">DefaultUser</a> then every new ToonTalk user 
  on that computer will be affected.</li>
  <li>Adding to the command line (typically of an icon). If you add &quot;<a href="command.htm#DefaultUser">-default_user</a> 
  username&quot; to the command line of the ToonTalk icon then every new user who 
  starts ToonTalk using that icon will be affected. You may want to create 
  multiple icons with different default users for different purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that if the main notebook of your default user contains user pictures or 
sounds that are not also in the default user's saved city then you need to set
<a name="SaveMediaInMainNotebook" href="ttini.htm#SaveMediaInMainNotebook"><span lang="en-gb">
SaveMediaInMainNotebook</span>=1</a> in toontalk.ini.</p>

<p><span lang="en-gb">Also note that if your default user has a saved city and 
the user logs in with a user name that already has a saved city they will end up 
in the their saved city, not the saved city of the default user. You can avoid 
this by using <a href="command.htm#MustBeNewUser">-must_be_new_user 1</a> on the 
command line.</span></p>

<p><b>Tips</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pick a user name for your default user that a user won't pick 
  accidentally. Anyone logging with the default user's name will change things 
  for all future new users.</li>
  <li>If you save a city while logged in as the default user then everything is 
  saved including things like the contents of <a href="dusty.htm">Dusty</a>'s 
  stomach. One way to save a city with nothing in Dusty's stomach is to build a 
  temporary house, go there, have Dusty spit out everything, and then have a 
  robot destroy the house <i>after</i> you have left the house. If the robot 
  destroys the house while you are in then Dusty will suck everything up again.</li>
  <li>It is OK to add to the main notebook but removing or replacing things can 
  cause confusion. There may even be robots that were trained to, say, find a 
  sensor in the sensor notebook on page 4. If you replace page 4 with something 
  else then that robot will break.</li>
  <li>You might want to delete the USR file of the default user since this 
  contains information like what things Marty has already explained and what 
  puzzles you have already done. On the other hand if you want to customize how 
  Marty speaks or how much he speaks using the <a href="options.htm">Options</a> notebook then leave the 
  USR file alone.<p id="DontRead" align="center"><small><a href="toontalk.htm">home</a> | <a href="search.htm">search</a> | <a href="buy.htm">purchase</a> | <a href="doc.htm">manual</a>

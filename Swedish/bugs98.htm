<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/4/98</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made various changes to how demos are recorded. Now supports
    demos recorded for low and high resolution graphics that share the same subtitles,
    narration, and name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/5</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another bug in replaying demos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where puzzle #48 put up a dialog box suggesting
    you go back 5 puzzles. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird is flying to her nest and it is in your pocket then
    when you stood up she froze until you sat down again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the wording of some of the puzzles between 42 and
    48.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle #54 was broken.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in puzzles where you saw extra copies of what
    you were pointing to.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of the goal in puzzle #41.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Replaying demos used to turn of speech. Now it does so only
    if the demo has narration and the text-to-speech engine is not using DirectSound.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a bird removed things from her nest to put a
    new thing on the bottom the nest would become invisible for a short while. And the size of
    the new thing added to the bottom of the stack on top of the nest was the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird was delivering something to its nest which is in
    your pocket and you are outside, then sometimes when going inside while the bird was
    trying to reach you it would get stuck outside until you went out again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped something on a box while something was in
    progress in falling into a hole then the drop was ignore. This was true even if you were
    dropping something on a different part of the box. Now only if the same hole is involved
    is it ignored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a box was moved while something was falling into a hole
    then that item was not displayed at the right place until the box was dropped.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved just before doing the puzzle where you were
    supposed to use a bomb then when started again the house you needed to blow up wasn't
    there. Now you start again on the previous puzzle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes while doing puzzles involving a stack of things on
    the nest ToonTalk got mixed up and the robot would wait even though everything was fine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved how Marty responds to wrong answers for the bomb
    puzzle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If during puzzles you bring a bomb back to Marty he'll now
    explain how bombs work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally during puzzles a robot gets stuck on the wall --
    fixed now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have a nest in your pocket then sometimes while
    standing or sitting and a bird was flying towards you ToonTalk would behave strangely or
    crash.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">After solving puzzle #49 ToonTalk would sometimes put up a
    dialog box saying you needed to go back 8 puzzles. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for
    reporting this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where birds flying between houses would get stuck
    if you entered the house where it came from.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug replaying demos where Dusty is turned on by the
    right mouse button.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems supporting temporary users (indicated by
    -t 1 on the command line -- a user profile is not kept for them).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems going from puzzle #55 to #61 (sometimes
    skipped to #62 and didn't save right). (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos are now interrupted by any mouse click.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Subtitles continued even if you took control of a demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in -autodemo &lt;n&gt; which is for museum or
    store use.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the end of the new exploding houses demo
    in low res.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems that sometimes caused subtitles of
    demos to stay up too briefly or long.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that broke the remote controls for a picture that
    were yes/no answers to questions.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with puzzle #63 and following. (Thanks to
    Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory problem with the destruction of pictures that
    have been flipped twice.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On slow machines the subtitles appeared too early.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When running in a window (not full-screen) and moving the
    mouse wildly the system mistook this for a problem and offered inappropriate trouble
    shooting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When tossing a picture on another picture (by holding down
    the control button), the picture underneath acted as if the user hit the space bar and
    changed appearance or color.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a fairly recent bug that broke the remote control for
    the looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a number of the remote control for that
    number's looks (obtained by flipping it over) then ToonTalk crashed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a display bug where if you pointed to a robot or truck
    you sometimes saw &quot;ghosts&quot; of old items.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finished updating all the demos. They now work better and in
    both high and low resolution.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that caused the system to be unstable after
    solving a level. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this and helping track it
    down.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes after solving puzzle #61 ToonTalk would say you
    have to go back a puzzle and then send you forward instead. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace
    for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when numbers and remote controls for how something
    looks were added then Bammer the Mouse would hit is hammer at the wrong place. (Thanks to
    Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped some text on some text and then dropped more
    before Bammer came then letters were lost. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting
    this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a demo was paused while the programmer was holding
    something a Java applet was generated and run.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demo files now record which puzzle file (if any) the demo
    started from.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally ToonTalk generated very large &lt;user
    name&gt;.log files. These are now limited to 100 lines (except for the debugging version
    of ToonTalk). (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 10 released on the Internet. </font></li>
  <li><a name="Beta10A"></a><font face="Comic Sans MS">A magic wand out of magic now only

    suggesting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in saving a room to the clipboard via F6 (used in
    making puzzles).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle #16 had a text pad with A on it on the side for no
    reason.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle #5 had Dusty underneath some junk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that caused the 16-bit version to stop replaying
    a demo if flying above a city with trucks driving around. (This broke the exploding houses
    demo.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the low resolution version of part 2 of the Ping Pong
    demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos now run in a window if a user has chosen that option in
    &quot;Set Options&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you use &quot;Set Options&quot; to indicate &quot;museum
    mode&quot; then it takes effect immediately (rather than the way it was which was next
    time you start ToonTalk).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the Swedish version so it runs older versions of the
    demos which have synchronized narration.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed the minimize and maximize buttons from the dialog
    asking your name. (Thanks to Oliver Gerards for pointing this out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Shrunk the size of the &quot;Loading from CDROM&quot; message
    (thanks to a suggestion from Shelly C. Wallace).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Used to be that if you held down space then the system
    autorepeat would cause ToonTalk to act like you pressed it multiple times. No longer.
    (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Running a demo no longer changes the default name in the
    dialog that asks your name. (Thanks to Oliver Gerards for pointing this out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you picked up a box inside of a box, stood up, sat down,
    and dropped something into the inner box the system crashed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with remote controls of the appearance of a
    number where the width the number would change rapidly if the number changed its number of
    digits.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you typed to a number with robots on
    the back, the number wouldn't look like it changed until you picked it up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 16-bit version can now be exited by typing Alt-F4.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that broke puzzle #64 and a few afterwards.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where certain kinds of pictures ended up at the
    wrong place on the floor after saving and restoring a city.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sometimes if you come back to doing puzzles
    after having done free play something that was supposed to be in your hand wasn't.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved a room (say to make a puzzle) then sometimes
    when the room was restored things that were on top of other things were now underneath.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">(This caused puzzle #5 to be solvable without using Dusty as
    intended.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In puzzle mode (but not free play) it was possible to lose
    something just off the edge of the screen. Your hand can now reach further in all four
    directions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Pumpy is used to make something a good size ('G') then you
    sometimes got the wrong sound effect and it would happen instantly rather than be
    animated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you were running the 16 bit version in full-screen mode
    and some other program got the focus (e.g. you typed Alt-Tab) then when ToonTalk was
    resumed it was in a Window rather than full-screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes boxes with lots of holes had very narrow see
    through gaps.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Numbers no longer act like they are selected when first typed
    to. They now behave like text pads do to typing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle had a robot with a training counter then used to
    be after it went to zero you could still training it to do more if you quickly did another
    action.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The display of the number of steps left for training a robot
    in puzzle mode improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pressing F1 while walking outside will now call for the
    helicopter (as well as 'h' and 'H' as before).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when training a robot to give a bird something the
    bird would fly off with the item but drop it in view (if the item was wide enough).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you try to pick up a tool that a robot is holding you know
    grasp the robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The placement of solutions was wrong for user defined
    puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The geometry of things put on the wall using the wall
    decoration remote was broken.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;Back&quot; button on &quot;Set Options&quot; did
    work on the last page (unless more than 1 language version was installed). (Thanks to
    Oliver Gerards for pointing this out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty showed www.toontalk and left off
    the .com part. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you walk into the house after solving the last puzzle it
    now says &quot;Thanks&quot;. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting the old behavior.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you paused a demo and then it lost focus (e.g. a screen
    saver started running) then ToonTalk would iconize which is OK but it wouldn't start
    again. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle #48 had a recently introduced bug so that the timer
    remote showed &quot;no&quot;. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you quit on the first puzzle or on the first two robot
    puzzles you are now offered to see hint files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you paused while holding a scale, ToonTalk used to try to
    generate a Java applet of the scale.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of number and text pads by halving
    the darker colored part between characters.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you create something with user pictures and then generate
    a Java applet if a file of the same name but which is a GIF file rather than a BMP file
    exists on the Java subdirectory then it'll be used instead.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">This fixes the problem that applets can't deal with BMP files
    (while Java applications can).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Similarly user sounds used in Java applets will use AU rather
    than WAV files if found.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In puzzle mode sometimes when a robot failed it would make a
    failing noise even when you were outside. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting
    this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Java applets were no longer making sound effects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User defined sound effects sometimes caused the system to
    crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The label on the roof, house, and wall decorations in the
    sensor notebook were wrong.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with pausing and resuming ToonTalk. (When
    Windows has more than 256 colors and the 16-bit version and interactions with
    screen-savers.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">16 bit version showing a demo in full-screen when interrupted
    by another program (or Alt-Tab) then when resumed was no longer full-screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Interrupting a demo and then resuming made the mouse cursor
    visible.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">16 bit version looked terrible when power was turned off (F8)
    and running with Windows with other than 256 colors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">16 bit version would try to read from the CDROM even if
    everything was installed on hard drive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Both versions tried to read from CDROM to try to run a demo
    that didn't exist.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Start ToonTalk displayed the buttons in an ugly manner when
    Windows was running in with large fonts.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you haven't used ToonTalk for a while you got an offer to
    reset Marty's user model even if you were just playing the puzzle game.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when restarting a puzzle (with a bomb) you lost
    what was in your hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes inside the rocket a solution was posted over the
    door rather than in a good slot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the alarm clock puzzle if you brought any empty nest but
    then the bird never delivered the nest was posted on the wall anyway.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the placement of Dusty in puzzle 64 (was very near the
    top). (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot would wait on box just off the top of the
    screen. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would crash trying to describe something it knew
    nothing about. Now he says nothing.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug (on 1/31) where if you ran a
    puzzle where a robot started off holding a wand then it needed to be holding the wand at
    the end of training. (Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace and Marc for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Provided support for -language British (including proper
    handling of large numbers and speaking them).</font></li>
  <li><a name="Beta11"></a><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released Beta 10A on the Internet.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when ToonTalk is showing a dialog box, ToonTalk
    would get restarted and cause confusion: mouse hidden, blank window shown, dialog box
    buried sometimes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/27</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when trouble shooting was turn off (via Set
    Options), then the ToonTalk window would minimize and restore itself automatically.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You now receive force feedback if you are using a force
    feedback joystick compatible with Microsoft DirectX 5.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot that wasn't being watched picked a
    place to put something on the floor, he put it on the wall by mistake.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you quit doing puzzles while on the first one or the first
    2 robot puzzles then even in free play ToonTalk put up a dialog box offering hints.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the trial version of ToonTalk has less than 14 days left

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Subtitles did not stay up the proper amount of time if
    ToonTalk's speed was other than 100. (Only influenced the Fibonacci demo.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Set Options was set for users who were beginners and
    ToonTalk terminated due to trial over or bad installation then it just exited. Now you get
    a dialog.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On start up ToonTalk filled the entire screen with a white
    window for a few seconds. No longer.</font></li>

    something else before the mouse came you got an empty text pad. Thanks to Shelly Wallace

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where if a robot started off with a tool (as in
    many puzzles) and set it down and then picked it up he got a new version of the tool. And
    if a wand then copy counter was gone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you closed the dialog box asking for your name then

    Also the blank number became non-blank before the mouse smashed it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to drop something on a blank box, the
    robot got confused. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to push buttons of a tool, the robot
    got confused. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a text pad on a notebook, sometimes it would
    not go to a matching page. Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no drop feedback if something was attached to the
    wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made several improvements to drop feedback.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now drop numbers on remote controls that have a list
    of values (e.g. &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; or &quot;see some&quot;, &quot;see
    all&quot;, and &quot;see nothing&quot;).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">UK version was adding spurious warnings about missing strings
    to log files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while a bird was moving the stack of things off her nest
    to put a new item on the bottom, you grabbed the item, or stack, or the nest confusion
    could follow. No longer grabable while bird is moving things around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while Marty was speaking and using talk balloons you
    pressed PageDown many times, Marty would sometimes show an empty balloon for a while.
    Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Start ToonTalk now has a button for an &quot;about&quot; box
    (to keep lawyers happy).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you pause ToonTalk while Marty is speaking, he know
    stops mid-sentence. Narration too.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made the text for puzzle #8 less ambiguous.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you try to train a robot to give a box to another robot,
    Marty said you can't train a robot to train a robot. Now if that robot is already trained,
    Marty says you can't train a robot to give a box to a robot.</font></li>

    between a sensor and a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you called for a tool (e.g. F2 for Dusty) and then picked
    up something before Dusty jumped into your hand, Dusty got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot on a box containing the sensor for
    &quot;who is colliding&quot; with a picture, then the thought bubble was wrong and
    matching didn't work right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trial version no longer lets you save notebooks or cities.
    Sorry.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when certain items (like nests and scales) in boxes

    seen. (But they could be picked up.) Thanks to Jeroen van Hilst for helping track this
    down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture on a picture became very small and then was

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on May 5, which causes the system to
    crash if a collision detector is used while something is destroyed (e.g. dropped in the
    notebook). Ping Pong Act 2 demo crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you copied something that was a part of something, the
    copy sometimes had an odd size. Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for pointing this out.</font></li>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Dusty or Pumpy was running into your hand while you stood
    up then when you sat down, he looked funny in your hand until you dropped him.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird was delivering something to a nest and a robot was
    removing things from the nest and you were watching standing up then sometimes ToonTalk
    crashed. Sometimes this happened in puzzle #48. Thanks to Sven Huberti for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pick up something before Bammer the Mouse smashes it
    then both items move together until smashed together.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes after Marty gave the final hint for a puzzle, if
    you came back to him he would present an empty talk balloon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes things didn't quite fix in a boxes hole -- but
    where a little bit too big or small. Thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for pointing this out. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to have Dusty spit something out, then
    it got confused when you tried to pick up the thing spit out.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to use Dusty, set him down, and then
    use him again the second time Dusty was too big and not positioned right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now add a bird to the back of a picture. This is
    useful in conjunction with the sensor which shows who you are colliding with. You can
    vacuum off the picture from the sensor, flip it over, get the bird, and give it a message.
    This is great for advanced game and simulation programming.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty can now talk about robots that are trained to
    manipulate the thought bubbles of other robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you were holding a robot over another robot and then call
    for Marty, he used to describe the robot underneath -- not the one you are holding.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes while Marty is talking and you send him away (with
    F1), he displays some old thing he had said for a few seconds before leaving.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved a city with a bird or nest whose other part was
    in Dusty the vacuum, then when loading the city the bird or nest was created with unknown
    counterparts. They now create the missing part when released.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped anything other than a text or number pad on a
    blank box, Marty repeatedly gave a somewhat inappropriate warning.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Blank robots are now supported. Good for putting in boxes in
    thought bubbles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a team of robots on a blank number pad, it now
    gets the number of robots in the team.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a team of robots on a blank box, it now gets one
    robot per hole.</font></li>

    &quot;backspace&quot; (not says &quot;backspace key&quot; and all is well).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty sometimes said things like &quot;And then pick up a
    text.&quot; now says &quot;And then pick up a text pad.&quot;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if Marty teleports in when the last place he was

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to set off a bomb and then run that
    robot on the back of a picture that you are holding, sometimes ToonTalk would crash.
    Thanks to Carl R. Witty for reporting this problem.</font></li>

    pad would turn non-blank a second before getting the value of the other.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a text pad on a blank text pad, the text pad
    on top was destroyed after being smashed. But that wasn't consistent with other uses of

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes Bammer the Mouse would wait 1 second before

    limit is exceeded. Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you took out options like ToonTalk's speed, or Marty's
    letter size, or Marty's talking speed and tried to rub them out to type a new value they
    would not accept 0 as a value but would jump to 100. Thanks to Benedikt Schmitt for
    reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Very large and zero size values of ToonTalk's speed, or
    Marty's letter size, or Marty's talking speed now work better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you finished all the puzzles and then restart ToonTalk,
    then it asks you if you want to redo all the puzzles. If you said yes it got confused.
    Thanks to David Kahn for discovering this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an anomaly repeatedly happened before ToonTalk was
    initialized then you got repeated message boxes about it. Now the limit is 4.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty says &quot;+, -, or space bar&quot; as &quot;plus or
    space bar&quot;. Now he says &quot;'+', '-', or space bar&quot; and reads it as &quot;plus
    minus or space bar&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a sensor with a picture on it on a blank picture
    the blank picture gets the appearance of the remote control (but isn't active). This is
    like dropping a numerical sensor on a zero.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Overhauled some of the error reporting. Some errors would
    cause Marty to appear but he would spell the message since he couldn't say the words.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If anything important is in the user log and the user has
    indicated in the &quot;Set Options&quot; that they are &quot;knowledgeable users&quot;
    then when they quit a dialog box appears offering to show them the log.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when saving a city where some things got lost
    (e.g. sometimes when a picture was flipped over when saved).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem trying to read non-existent files when
    compiled with Microsoft VC++.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that prevented offering help when quitting on
    the first puzzle or first robot puzzle.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the message saying that the
    beta or trial version has expired didn't appear.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a few problems with trouble shooting dialogs not
    appearing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new dialog offering to show user their log file was
    sometimes buried under other windows.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty had problems talking about variable width text pads
    (used for labels in notebooks).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a box held by a robot kept getting
    wider.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now re-train robots. If you vacuum out the box from a
    robot's thought bubble and give a box to the robot you'll re-enter his thoughts. He'll do
    what he was trained to do until you press a mouse or keyboard button.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes a nest was shared across
    loads from multiple files or notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty used to say &quot;0.&quot; as &quot;zero point&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in the UK and Swedish version where &quot;1,
    2, 3,&quot; was said wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the dialog box offering to show log file appeared
    even if Set Options was used to select inexperienced users who shouldn't be bothered.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you selected the option that Marty shouldn't speak and
    that text balloons should stay up until you click, they zoomed by very quickly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug that interfered with the
    Fibonacci demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trial version didn't put up box saying that it will expire in
    n days.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trial version put up a dialog box when you tried to save
    something in your notebook but it was sometimes buried under other windows.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The variable width text pads (used in labels in the notebook)
    did not respond to the remote controls for &quot;see some&quot; vs. &quot;see all&quot;
    and for text color.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ToonTalk memory cache had a maximum size of 25% of
    physical memory. It now is 25% of the smaller of physical memory and available virtual
    memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If toontalk.ini has an entry DefaultUser=X then new users
    will get the default city, notebook, and tool layout of user X. (Wasn't documented and
    city aspect not implemented previously.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally the system crashed after sitting down after
    having stood up from the grass.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saving a city when sitting on the ground produced a city that
    couldn't be loaded properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Remote controls for decorating the room, house, or roof
    behaved badly if you are on the ground.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak when the vacuum was used while training a
    robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak when a robot was trained to give a bird
    something.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Due to a fix on 6/4 when a t-shirt of a bird was text it had
    a white background. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't return a picture to a stack by dropping it on
    the stack.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when something was selected, some part of it would
    get a white border around it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty would cause very long delays in
    describing some foreign birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Marty would repeat himself after
    describing a foreign bird.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If there was an error loading a city, then the message
    appeared in the credits.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If there was an error creating a foreign bird while loading a
    city, then text-to-speech was turned off.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed 2 minor memory leaks in the puzzle game.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The AutoPlay program on the CDROM mistakenly thought ToonTalk
    was not installed when it had been installed with the &quot;Compact&quot; option.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would sometimes when saying lots of things, cut a
    sentence short (start next sentence after 2 seconds).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the system mouse cursor would be visible while
    ToonTalk was running.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to return things to a stack.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem retraining a robot to add a label to a box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a bird was returning to a house that has been
    blown up the system crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to drop things in a truck.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to give things to a bird.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in retraining a robot to find things in notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes quitting ToonTalk while training a robot crashed
    the system.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory leak when dealing with old robots (created
    before they had serial numbers). Also serial numbers were generated incorrectly for old
    robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot trained to take something from a notebook,
    when running would take a page from the opposite side of the book.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots being retrained who dropped things on a notebook got
    confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a robot is being trained to use the vacuum, it
    crashed when you were finished training him.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the sample programs primes.tt and dfact.tt (available
    from programs.htm).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The factorial demo's narration stopped in the middle of the
    last sentence. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for pointing this out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The factorial demo's last sentence had the subtitles stay up
    much too briefly. Still goes away before sentence is over. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for
    pointing this out.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where in puzzles the
    connection between birds and nests was broken. So nests had eggs in them. (Thanks to
    Shelly Wallace for pointing this out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed many bugs in retraining robots within puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">After each retraining a robot got taller and thinner. No
    longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the system to crash during
    shut down while retraining.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you blew up the wrong house in puzzle 49, then you found a
    very large number in your hand when you re-entered the house. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace
    for reporting this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle 49 (the one that introduces bombs) no longer posts
    anything when you blow up the other house. (Thanks to Shelly Wallace for pointing this
    out.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the autoplay executables (clickme.exe
    and just32.exe) had launching ToonTalk when ToonTalk has been un-installed. Now offers to
    re-install instead.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If text-to-speech was installed but narrations were not then
    demos had speech which sometimes made them terminate early.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some exceptional conditions displayed dialog boxes that on
    the 16-bit version and a 640x480 were partly off the screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If running the 32-bit version with an 8-bit sound card, then
    the text-to-speech engine fails to start. It now offers trouble shooting advice for how to
    fix this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flipped over a picture with a picture on top you got a
    confusing warning from Marty and the remote control notebook wasn't quite right.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a picture on a picture then it was displayed
    clipped to the region of the picture underneath before Bammer smashed it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you move the ToonTalk window (not running full-screen) it
    now displays properly. You can also re-shape the Window. Alt-space puts up the menu.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you flip over a picture with a picture on top, the end
    of the notebook of remote controls has a notebook for each &quot;sub-picture&quot;. If you
    took one of those notebooks and dropped it back where it came from ToonTalk crashed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the notebooks at the end of the remote control
    notebook was missing the last ordinary remote control and label. This also confused the
    sub-picture notebooks.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture had multiple things moving on top of it and some
    of those pictures had parts as well, then sometimes pictures would slide between another
    picture and its parts.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture was moving slowly on another picture then
    pointing to the picture or making it move on the floor made the moving picture stop due to
    round off errors. The fix for this means that pictures several times larger than the
    screen might look wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when Marty was describing a remote control for the
    looks of something else, he started speaking nonsense.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally notebooks containing robots (and that weren't
    open to page 1) when saved in the main notebook, caused the system the crash when they
    were reconstructed next time. (Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for his help tracking this down.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the generation of comments in Java code for
    describing what had just been constructed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Generation of Java code was sometimes broken when birds and
    nests were involved. (E.g. Ping Pong game didn't translate right.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If power is off (e.g. via F8) then flipping a picture with
    robots on the back over and then over again started the robots running.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the geometry of large boxes where sometimes the
    contents weren't displayed at quite the right place.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed puzzle 31 so Marty says &quot;Try to make a box with
    your birthday in it.&quot; rather than &quot;Trying making a box with your birthday in
    it.&quot;</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Re-did the end of the Ping Pong demos (parts 2 and 3).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving robots if they have been taken out of
    a notebook that is in the main notebook.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with robots on the back of pictures that are
    on the back of other pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You used to see birds fly out of a picture to another spot on
    the back of a picture if you dropped the picture in a box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dropping pictures with robots on the back on
    the clipboard -- sometimes it was unnecessarily too large to save.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The largest encoding for saving an object on the clipboard is
    doubled. (64K before custom uuencoding).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The debugging version gave a spurious warning if you pressed
    Esc during the titles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed the faulty dizzy sample program from programs.htm and
    javademo.htm, and replaced it with nicer movies program.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the Swedish version that confused numbers and
    text in some puzzles (including #2).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If text-to-speech was not installed, then the 32-bit version

</ol>

<p><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/7</font></a> 

<ol>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed 2 bugs when generating a Java applet
    of a ToonTalk picture that is or contains a picture of the programmer walking wearing a

</ol>

<p><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/9</font></a> 

<ol>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when running with Windows more
    than 256 colors when ToonTalk terminated it left Direct Draw is an inconsistent state so
    you needed to restart the computer to run ToonTalk again.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem on some web browsers
    running ToonTalk's Java demos.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revised puzzles 47 and 48 so they work fine
    if a correct but unexpected solution was presented in puzzle 43.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving to the clipboard the
    contents of the floor of a room (via F6) where birds and nests lost their connection.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the US version that it

  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in producing Java applets where
    a robot used a vacuum in reverse.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revised the internal working of the sensor
    which shows who you are colliding with so that if the &quot;collidee&quot; has stuff on
    the back it is not copied until the picture is vacuumed off the sensor.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you walked out during the alarm clock
    puzzle (#54), the system would crash. Thanks to Tyler Breisacher for reporting this and

    when the text-to-speech engine wouldn't initialize properly.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in generating Java for a robot
    that vacuums something off of a sensor with a picture on it (e.g. &quot;colliding with
    who&quot;).</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now generate Java for a robot that
    flips over pictures and takes a bird off the back. (Important when used with
    &quot;colliding with who&quot;).</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Colliding with who now translates to Java

<ol>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pressed Escape while retraining a

  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you were training a robot with an
    initial tool (like the wand in many of the puzzles) and you left junk on the floor, then
    the robot would automatically add to his training the vacuuming of stuff left behind but
    would forget about the initial tool. Thanks to Tyler Breisacher for helping to track this
    down.</font></a></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/13</font></a> 

<ol>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while running a demo and the power

<ol>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you start ToonTalk with a different user

    trouble shooting for a previous crash.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you typed Alt-F4 during some puzzles,
    then the 32-bit version of ToonTalk would sometimes put up a DirectX error message and

</ol>

<p><a name="Beta13A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/17</font></a>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you double clicked on the file with your user profile
    (your USR file) then if you chose to play the puzzle game, it would ask for your name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you double clicked on a demo file (DMO) then it ran but
    unless the narration and/or subtitles were in the same directory they were ignored. Now it

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a city or notebook file was corrupted then ToonTalk would

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a city was made size 1 (just one block) then the

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the 4 Swedish narrations for demos.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving a robot whose thought bubble contains a

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot in another house was dropping things on a notebook
    while you or a robot you were watching was also doing so, ToonTalk got confused. Thanks to
    Tyler Breisacher for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot in another house was dropping things on a notebook
    and you picked up the notebook you could sometimes stop the robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk offered trouble shooting help just as it started
    (for example, about why it might have crashed the previous time), then after the dialog
    ToonTalk was not quite restored properly. Either the screen was white until you pressed
    enter or the colors were wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk was started with -tts_uses_ds 1 (so the
    text-to-speech engine uses DirectSound) then it would crash if you quit ToonTalk while
    Marty was talking.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you finished all the puzzles, quit and then chose Play
    Game then ToonTalk would sometimes crash. Thanks to Joe Pixton for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you finished all the puzzles, quit and then chose Play
    Game then ToonTalk then ToonTalk would be put up a dialog box asking if you wanted to
    start over. The dialog box was often buried under other windows.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you put something on the ToonTalk clipboard object, the
    encoding includes spaces. Some mail readers ignore leading spaces causing the encodings to

    earlier. Or earlier than 1.01 in the product version.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The instructions that accompany a clipboard encoding now

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you typed enter to make a multi-line variable text pad
    (like the one's that label your notebook), then sometimes there was a single pixel gap
    between lines.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you typed rubout to the &quot;which picture&quot; remote
    control if the picture was synthetic (but not rectangular) or it was text then it didn't
    remove the last digit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flipped a text pad over, set it down, pointed to it,
    and pressed 'f' nothing happened. It now adds 'f' to the text string.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you exited the full-screen 16-bit version with Alt-F4
    during the first puzzle or the first robot puzzle then the dialog box offering help was
    not visible. (It looked like it crashed but pressing Enter answered the dialog box and
    freed things up.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Reworked the clipboard encoding to rely upon the Base64
    encoding used by MIME mail. This is both more compact and uses only characters that mail
    system will certainly leave untouched. Thanks to Daniel Biddle for suggesting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when putting a robot on the clipboard that came
    from a notebook, the encoding of the robot was very large since it included an encoding of
    the notebook as well. It worked but was wasteful.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The hints for puzzle #35 suggested you vacuum up a 1 when you
    should just erase it. Thanks to Lennart Mogren for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed away the contents of a robot's thought bubble
    while he was still part of a team and then gave the team a box, then after retraining the
    robot ToonTalk crashed. You can now only retrain a robot after separating him from the
    team. Thanks to Tyler Breisacher for reporting this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a bird flies out from under a picture then
    what she is holding was invisible for a while.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the number of frames was over 210,000 then the frames per
    second calculation in the users log file was wrong. Thanks to Daniel Biddle for reporting

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to use the main notebook then
    sometimes and you stood up while he was running then sometimes the robot would wait for
    you to sit again. Also the notebook would sometimes get to be very tall. Thanks to Julian
    Pixton for help with this.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzle number 74 the hints had \ rather than / for division.
    Thanks to Daniel Biddle for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when running ToonTalk in Window you got the message
    &quot;Window multiple ok now.&quot; in your log file. Thanks to Daniel Biddle for
    reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored the old (and documented) behavior of the controller
    for the visibility of pictures. &quot;See All&quot; and &quot;See Some&quot; differed only
    if the picture had sub pictures added to it. Now it controls whether the black background
    is visible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">With the restoration of the old meaning of the visibility
    controller the default for pictures in the notebook on page 2 is now &quot;See Some&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when saving a notebook some pages were lost.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the meaning of &quot;See Nothing&quot; for the
    visibility remote control when a picture has had pictures added to it. Previously they too
    became invisible but not any longer. You must set their visibility remote controls to
    &quot;See Nothing&quot; as well. Also if a picture is part of an invisible (See Nothing)
    picture then its collision detectors detect collisions, not with other parts of that
    picture, but with pictures that are &quot;siblings&quot; of the picture it is a part of.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The notebook of remote controls for a picture had the fixed
    width (ugly) form of text pads.</font></li>

  <li><a name="Beta14A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty gave misleading hints for puzzles 51
    and 54 when he suggested that you vacuum something away. He now suggests you erase those
    things. Also scale.htm now documents why the difference matters. Thanks to Lennart Mogren
    for reporting this.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta14A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you picked up a text pad and typed

  <li><a name="Beta14A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied something containing the

    Thanks to Daniel Biddle for reporting this.</font></a></li>
  <li><a name="Beta14A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk had problems describing erased

  <li><a name="Beta14A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot has been trained to drop

  <li><a name="Beta14A"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote controls for the address (street
    and avenue remote controls) could be correctly manipulated like numbers but then when
    moved to another location or even put inside something they would reset the address of the
    house they were in. Now once an address remote control is changed it stays that way unless
    explicitly changed by the programmer or a robot. These fixed versions do not have the

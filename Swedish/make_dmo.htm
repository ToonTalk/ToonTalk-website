<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>How to Create Your Own Demos</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can also make narrated or subtitled </font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF0000">
<a href="mk_ttdmo.htm">demos using time travel</a></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">. 
Such demos will have VCR-like controls for replaying and skipping sections.</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i>Advanced users:</i></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To create a demo just add -o &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt; to <a
href="command.htm#OutputLog">the command line</a> before starting ToonTalk. This will
create a file named filename.DMO in the &quot;demos&quot; subdirectory of ToonTalk. The
&quot;dmo&quot; file records everything you do (every mouse movement, keyboard click,
etc.) Double clicking on the file will start up the demo. Alternatively adding -I
&lt;filename&gt; to the command line will run the demo. Please check the &quot;demos&quot;
subdirectory first to learn the names of existing demos so you don't override them. Note
that if the command line includes both -I and -o then the newly created output demo will
just contain the new part of the demo. At the Windows command line you can put together
the two parts of a demo by entering &quot;copy /b demo1.dmo+demo2.dmo demo3.dmo&quot;
where demo2.dmo was created as an extension to demo1.dmo. Alternatively set
<a href="ttini.htm#GenerateLogs">GenerateLogs</a> to a value greater than 0 and 
then retrieve and rename the demos created in the Demos folder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding subtitles to your demos</b>.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk starts
running a demo named X it looks for a file named X.ust. (&quot;ust&quot; is the default
extension name for American English subtitles - in general the extension is the two-letter
country code followed by 't'.) You can override the default for your computer by providing
an &quot;<a href="ttini.htm#SubtitlesSuffix">SubtitlesSuffix</a>&quot; entry in the &quot;FileExtensions&quot; section of the
ToonTalk.ini file in your Windows directory. A subtitle file is made of entries separated
by a blank line. Each entry has the time in milliseconds since the beginning of the demo
followed by the text of the subtitle. It is recommended that any lines of text more than
60 characters be broken. The &quot;demos&quot; subdirectory of your ToonTalk installation
has many sample subtitle files. One way to obtain the millisecond timings is to press F9
while the demo is playing back. This will record the time in your &lt;user name&gt;.txt log
file in the &quot;users&quot; subdirectory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding narration to your demos</b>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk starts
running a demo named X it looks for a file named X.spk. (&quot;spk&quot; is the default
extension name for American English narration files - in general the extension is the
two-letter country code followed by 'n'.) You can override the default for your computer
by providing an &quot;SubtitlesSuffix&quot; entry in the &quot;FileExtensions&quot;
section of the ToonTalk.ini file in your Windows directory. To create a narration file you
should record segments of the narration (256 is the maximum number) and name them
&quot;s01.wav&quot;, &quot;s02.wav&quot; and so on. These files should be placed on the
main ToonTalk directory while generating the narration file. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To create the narration file (in the &quot;Demos&quot;
subdirectory) add '-create_narration 1' or '-create_narration 2' to the command line.
&nbsp; A value of 1 changes the meaning of F11 to mean start the next narration segment
(the next s&lt;nn&gt;.wav file). A value of 2 means use the start times from the subtitle
file. If you want to specify the times when the narration should start but don't want
subtitles, then create a temporary subtitle file (where the lines of text could be
anything (e.g. &quot;X&quot;) and only the start times are important. You can use
'-create_narration' together with '-o' or '-I' depending upon whether you want to create
the demo and narration at the same time, or to add narration to an existing demo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Coordinating the subtitles and narration</b>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wish
to create both narration and subtitles, you can create the subtitles first and use
'-create_narration 2' or else you can create the narration first and then run your demo
with &quot;-print_narration_start_times 1&quot; which will print the start times of each
segment in your &lt;<i>user name</i>&gt;.log in the &quot;Users&quot; subdirectory. You
can then use these times while creating your subtitles file. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Tips:</b></font> 

<ul>
  <li><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you make a mistake while recording a demo you needn't redo
    the whole thing. You can run toontalk -I PartlyGood -o NewVersion and then take control
    just before the old demo goes bad. </font></p></li>
  <li><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Avoid using keyboard accelerators for tools (e.g. 'e' to make
    Dusty erase things). These accelerators differ from language to language so if you use
    them your demos probably won't work in a different language version of ToonTalk. </font></p></li>
  <li><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are creating a demo on a fast computer and expect the
    demo to be run on slower machines then it is recommended that you add <a
    href="command.htm#FrameDurationMinimum">-y 50</a> (or a similar number) to the command
    line while recording to slow down your machine. And set the screen 
  resolution relatively low -- perhaps 800x600. Use 'Set Options' for this.</font></p></li>
  <li><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can create a video or animation of a demo by creating
    series of <a href="scrnshot.htm">screen snapshots</a>.</font></p></li>
  <li><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">

  If your demo includes Marty speaking then don't have Marty use subtitles 
  since then they can't be added to the demo as well. The talk balloon is a good 
  alternative (with or without text-to-speech).</font></p></li>

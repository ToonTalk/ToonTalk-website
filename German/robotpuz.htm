ToonTalk Puzzles</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A robot in ToonTalk can be trained by giving him a
box. You'll then enter his thought bubble. Whatever you do, the robot will remember. Some
robots can only remember a few steps. When a robot's memory fills up, you leave his
thought bubble. You can leave whenever you want by pressing the 'Esc' button. Once a robot
is trained you can give him a box. If the box matches what's in his thought bubble, then
he'll repeat what he was trained to do. If the box doesn't match what he's thinking of,
then Dusty will appear. You can use Dusty to remove stuff from the robot's thought bubble
so he isn't so fussy. A good habit is to remove only enough to make the robot happy with
what you want to give him.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Some robots have a magic wand that only they can
use. You'll have to train the robot to use the wand for you.</font></p>

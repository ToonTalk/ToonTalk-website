Similar lists for <a href="bugs97.htm">1997</a>, <a href="bugs98.htm">1998</a>, and <a
href="bugs.htm">1999</a> are available as well. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">No records were kept prior to 3/25/96 (the first public beta
release).&nbsp; Programming on ToonTalk began in October 1992.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/25/96 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pasting an object from ToonTalk had some non-standard new
    line (carriage return) characters. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/30 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The font used when Marty is talking (and the opening screen)
    was under-specified so on some machines looked very bad. Now Arial is used unless
    overridden by -e &lt;font name&gt; </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/4 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a minor bug when user enters a long name with spaces or
    other non-alphanumeric characters. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that can lead to a crash when training a robot to
    use certain kinds of remote controls (&quot;Which picture?&quot; and the Lego sensors). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something other than a box was placed on top of a robot
    without anything in his thought bubble and then a box was dropped on the robot or thought
    bubble such that a part of it overlapped with the object on top of the robot but it mostly
    was over the robot then confusion followed. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to attach box to the side on another
    and then when working tried to add a box to the side of a blank box it crashed. Now robot
    stops and Martian explains problem. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when Martian was explaining why a robot stopped it
    would repeat part of the sentence and skip another part. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Scales sometimes would not change to tilt but robots still
    matched as if they were showing the right tilt. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/12 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 4/4 that may cause a memory
    violation on start up. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a robot would get confused and say he didn't expect
    to keep track of so many things. Not anymore. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The maximum city size is 255 (or -255 if you want it half
    filled with randomly placed houses) but you used to be able to set it to 256 and get weird
    results. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now explains city size maximums if you try to set size
    to bigger value. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/13 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a notebook had many pages (more than some number between
    100 and 1300) then system crashed while terminating. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/15 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a memory violation bug that generated no known
    symptoms. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Martian's advice about how to pause ToonTalk was only
    partially updated and he got confused. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk debugging switches causes logs of events to be
    generated. Type names in these logs were wrong. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the way robots keep track of items that are put
    inside something. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 32bit version was using a small cache size. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/16 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Swap if bigger&quot; robot in example notebook was
    broken. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots now no longer flip notebooks to page 1 before starting
    but do behave as if the main notebook was on page 1 when starting but &quot;flips&quot; to
    it only first time the robot sends keyboard characters to notebook. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture of a number or text with robots on the back was
    dropped on the clipboard remote control then only the text was saved now the entire thing.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Geometry of things on clipboard improved. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If multiple text pads were dropped on a text pad it sometimes
    crashed. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/18 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 4/15 regarding how robots keep

    dialog. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">While holding a notebook you can now use right-mouse to go to
    next page and middle-button to go back. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">32bit debugger complained about code using SelectObject.

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 4/16 that sometimes caused the
    system to crash when dealing with the ToonTalk clipboard. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Enumeration types (e.g. &quot;your heads looks&quot; which
    can be &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;long hair&quot;, or &quot;bald&quot;) when held can now be
    cycled through using the mouse (middle is backwards and right is forwards). </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/25 </font>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Aesthetic changes to pasting of a ToonTalk object. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/4 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nests destruction is postponed until their last bird. If the
    house is being destroyed and contains a nest and the last bird then there was a problem
    depending upon the order they were destroyed. The problem had no serious consequences. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/5 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot is trained to use the keyboard while
    holding or pointing to a notebook it got confused. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/7 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when robots in other houses are using the main
    notebook and the programmer is as well the response to typing digits to go to a particular
    page behaved oddly. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems with birds. E.g. when flying back to
    her nest and the nest if being transported by another bird, it led to unpredictable
    behavior. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/8 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you hold down F11, then ToonTalk will make snapshots of
    frames called frm&lt;number&gt;.bmp where number is the frame number. Successive identical
    frames are not saved. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/9 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more bugs with birds flying outside. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/10 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more bugs with birds flying outside. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot is trained to make sounds in another house then it
    used to get stuck. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot is making sounds in a house and the programmer
    leaves the sounds stop. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 4/26 where if you pointed to an
    object where something was on top, the thing on top couldn't be seen. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures lost their size if changed by remote controls but
    not if changed by the Bike Pump. [Thanks to Tobias for pointing this out.] </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/11 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more bugs with birds flying outside. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a new command line switch -bird 0 which makes it so
    birds take no time to return after delivering a message. Good for watching systolic
    algorithms. -bird 1 is the default which shows birds returning. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a bird would put something on her nest in a way in
    which you couldn't pick it off (though the vacuum could). </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/12 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ToonTalk clipboard used to be confused by programs that
    copied using a different convention about how carriage return/line feed work. (E.g.
    Netscape didn't work but wordpad did.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">For a while now you can put robots in a fresh notebook that
    were trained to find other robots in the main notebook (by dropping the label on the
    notebook). Used to only work if you found something in the notebook and only got one copy.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when pasting text into ToonTalk's clipboard boxes
    appeared which were unprintable characters from the carriage return/line feed problem. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">For very large multiple line text sometimes ToonTalk froze. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/20 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many small changes to what Marty the Martian says. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Re-structured internals of Marty so should be easier to
    translate to another language </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs with ordinals like 23th. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/21 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">More small changes to what Marty says. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now describes what can be done with remote controls
    (and options) in much more detail, including new ability to use mouse buttons to change
    things. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem using mouse buttons while holding an address.
    </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/22 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Used to be that if the command line set up some options but
    didn't specify the user name then it would ask for a user name and if it is an existing
    one then the options of that user would override the command line. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">One a few machines the full-screen mode is very slow. It now
    checks and warns the user if it is. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If there are problems running in full-screen mode (-f 1, e.g.
    on Windows NT) it will now switch over to -f 2. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/23 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed multiple bugs that occur when a bird's nest is copied
    and the copies are in different houses and the bird is given something. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a bird to receive something whose nest has been
    copied it used to copy the bird and message. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/24 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is now easier to return things to the notebook. If neither
    page is empty and something is dropped on top that is on one of the pages then it is
    returned regardless of which side of the notebook it is dropped. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If only one page is empty and something is dropped on the
    notebook it will go to the blank page regardless of which side it was on. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/26 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Windows95 version of ToonTalk started. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Win95 version uses Direct Sound sounds now mix and more audio
    features are now feasible. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sound effects notebook on page 8 was missing some newer
    sounds and still referring to obsolete sounds. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Win95 version does not use the file resind.dat. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/28 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to drop a box on a number it lost
    track of things. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot performed operations on a sensor, they were
    remembered but not seen while inside the thought bubble. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bug introduced on 5/20 where Marty sometimes when
    describing what a robot does says things like &quot;the new numbera number&quot;. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/30 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots trained to break a box into pieces by dropping it on a
    number, got stuck when running. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes changing the appearance of your head (between hat,
    bald, and long hair) corrupted some internal data. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when lots of birds and/or trucks are using a door
    then the programmer can't get through it even after the birds and trucks are done. Fixed
    now. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird was taking something to her nest in the same room
    and the programmer was looking at the house from the outside, you could see the bird fly
    out (backwards!) and then fly back in. No longer. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/31 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a number A is dropped on number B and before
    mouse smashes them together another number is dropped on A then the system crashed. Fixed.
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a zero-hole box was dropped on another it triggered an
    error (divide by zero). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a box was dropped next to a zero hole box, it would not
    click together. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a small or large box was broken into pieces one of the
    pieces was default size. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to flip through pages of a notebook
    then if the typing was fast it ended up on a different page when it was redoing the
    actions. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/2 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed recently introduced spurious warning from Marty when
    dropping something on a box containing a zero-hole box. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots trained to drop a box on a blank number got confused
    when running. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots trained to drop a box on a number sometimes got
    confused too. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changes to notebooks made on 5/24 had problem that if
    something was dropped on the right page and both left and right was empty it ended up on
    the left. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When holding something over the notebook, sometimes only one
    page wiggled as feedback now the entire notebook does. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem with robots running off screen that
    crashed the system. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If more than one bird returns to the same cubby (but
    different holes) things got confused. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a robot on a notebook and quickly flipped
    pages sometimes it used to crash. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a labeled box on a zero-hole box, it looked
    funny. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you made a zero-hole box blank its size was wrong. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied a partially visible picture of a number it used
    to become fully visible. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/3 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a robot was trained to drop things on a notebook
    to find the right page and if that robot is working in another house and the notebook is
    open to the page it is looking for it got mixed up about which page to get things from. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Programmed around Borland compiler bug that also occurred
    same time as above. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a bird is returning to a house before it blows
    up the memory and other resources taken by the things in the house weren't reclaimed when
    the house explodes. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot working off screen picked up a random number or
    mouse sensor from a notebook it would take a cycle before it became non-zero and might be
    used before that. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">32 bit version can now have a much deeper number of boxes
    insides of boxes. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/4 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a bird in another house whose nest has been
    copied was given something then a copy of the thing appeared on the floor (and went away
    if you stood up and sat down again). </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/5 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem robot's sometimes stop working and stay
    floating above everything else. This also fixes a problem with running some of the demos
    with the 32 bit version. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a new remote control for producing sounds. This is
    meant to make it easier for a user to import their own sounds (Wave and Midi files). </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/6 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 32bit version on some systems (especially Windows NT) had
    the problem that text and the street were drawn out of order so the helicopter landed
    under the street and text floated above things. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/9 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If sound is turned off on start up (-s 0 for example) then
    the 32 bit version will no longer initialize and later release the Direct Sound device. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If asked for your name and you click on the close box you get
    asked again. If you click on it again then ToonTalk is terminated. Only need to do it once
    now. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/11 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a new remote control for bringing into ToonTalk user
    art. Just drop the file name on the remote control and then vacuum up the result. The file
    should be in Windows BMP format and should work for any format. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flip over a user picture and use the remote control
    for visibility to make it &quot;see some&quot; then the black bits become transparent. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/12 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug with remote control for sound that when vacuumed
    up sometimes crashed or hung. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notebooks sometimes if copied and then the copies destroyed
    lead to inconsistent memory. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/16 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would sometimes make spurious warnings about full
    screen mode being too slow. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when vacuuming up a sound created by the
    &quot;file to sound&quot; remote control. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User defined pictures now can be saved in the notebook,
    copied, and used inside of a robot's thought bubble. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User defined sounds can now be stopped by vacuuming up the
    file name. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The file to sound remote control is now restored in the
    process. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes after taking off a house can be seen being built
    even though it was built long ago. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/17 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes door were shown for one frame far to the left of
    where they should be. Trucks driving into the house sometimes drove to this wrong location
    of the door. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when landing near a house being built it looked as
    if two trucks drove in. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Windows 95 version now uses DirectSound for the narration
    and for user audio. The sounds are all mixed as a result. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/18 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Used to be if you grabbed a truck or something out of it as
    it was driving away you could crash the system. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trucks used to &quot;sink&quot; below everything else as they
    drove off. Looked bad and stuff inside only partly &quot;dropped&quot; too. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was about to put something in a truck but the
    programmer put something in first confusion resulted. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a remote control for converting a file to a sound or
    picture was dropped in the notebook it got very small. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Remote control for file to sound now has a better size and
    shape when on the floor. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Better error messages when there is trouble loading a file as
    a picture or sound. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can no longer add text to a remote control for file to sound
    that already has a file name. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When user defined pictures are dropped on the clipboard
    remote control then Marty now reminds the user which files need to accompany the
    &quot;cutting&quot;. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User pictures in clipboard displayed wrong for all but one
    copy. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you place a remote sensor for a picture or the clipboard
    with something on it into the notebook now the thing &quot;on top&quot; is saved. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/19 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The geometry of boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes when
    expanded is now improved. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/2 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Redid the entire low-level graphics. The Win95 version now
    uses DirectDraw through out. -v 25 -f 1 now works in the Win95 version so with a fast
    machine you get fast, clean, high resolution images. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Minor improvement in how the bike pump jumps into your hand
    when you press F3 </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F12 now puts a copy of the screen on the clipboard. You can
    then paste the result into a paint program or the like. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/7 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with localization of ToonTalk to countries

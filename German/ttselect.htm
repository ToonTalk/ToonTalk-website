in ToonTalk</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you have installed ToonTalk from a CDROM and are
running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0, then Marty should be able to speak.
Here are some of the things that can go wrong:</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>No sound card.</b> Not surprisingly Marty can't
    speak if the operating system can't find the sound card.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Bad sound drivers.</b> The operating system needs
    programs called sound drivers to run the sound card. Yours may be missing, the wrong
    version, or too old. Contact your PC vendor or sound card vendor for the latest sound
    drivers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>8-bit sound card.</b> If your version of ToonTalk
    is earlier than 1.04 and your sound card is several years old then it might not be able to
    deal with 16-bit sound files. This problem has been fixed by the Microsoft speech group in
    SAPI 4.0 <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/stg">Click here</a> to visit the
    Microsoft speech group web site to get more information or the latest speech files.
    Installing Microsoft SAPI 4.0 (Speech API) fixes this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>An alternative.</strong> Marty speaks using
    Microsoft's Speech API communicating with Microsoft's DirectX components. If you are
    running ToonTalk version 1.04 or later, you can try turning this off by adding
    &quot;-tts_uses_ds 0&quot; to <a href="command.htm#TextToSpeechUsesDirectSound">the
    command line</a>. This will mean you will not hear any sound effects while Marty is
    speaking. If you are running a version before 1.04, then try &quot;-tts_uses_ds 1&quot; to
    turn this on.</font></li>

<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>For Immediate Release:</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>SAN MATEO, California - January
11, 1999 - Animated Programs today announced the release of ToonTalk™,
an educational computer software product that enables kids to learn and
use computer programming.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>ToonTalk is a new way of constructing,
debugging and running programs. In ToonTalk, programs are not constructed
by typing any text or by assembling pictures. They are built by taking
actions in an interactive animated world. Familiar objects like birds,
robots, trucks, and bike pumps are the only programming tools needed. ToonTalk
makes programming easy for children to understand by making programming
tangible and game-like. While learning how to program, children will face
challenging puzzles, express their creativity, learn new ways to solve
problems, and most of all have fun!</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Learning to Program</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Many educators question the
value of teaching programming, because it is hard to learn and hard to
do. Now, with ToonTalk, both children and adults can learn to program simply
by learning the behavior of familiar objects and using them to create their
own programs. ToonTalk includes a new way of learning programming – by
playing a game. In the game, players volunteer to help an injured Martian
named Marty repair his spaceship. In order to help Marty, they need to
solve a sequence of interactive puzzles that gradually introduce programming
constructs and techniques. The users are also introduced to familiar objects
such as boxes, houses, roads, robots, vacuum cleaners, etc. and how they
work within ToonTalk. The first three puzzles introduce numbers, addition
and boxes (data structures). The fourth puzzle starts the introduction
of familiar objects such as a magic wand and houses. By the eighth puzzle,
the player will use robots to make the first actual program. At any time
during the puzzles if a child is confused or needs help, Marty is ready
and willing to offer hints or complete directions if necessary. ToonTalk
also includes narrated programming demonstrations that show how to build
programs.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>ToonTalk was developed specifically
for children and provides three fundamentally different ways for children
to learn:</font></font>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1><b>Free play</b> – an open-ended,
unconstrained, rich environment to explore and create things</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1><b>A puzzle game</b> – a sequence
of puzzles which gradually introduce techniques for building programs</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1><b>Demonstrations</b> – narrated
demonstrations of various construction and debugging techniques</font></font></dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>The Power of Programming</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>ToonTalk is a general purpose
programming language. It has a property called "universality" so that in
principle any program can be created in ToonTalk. The majority of programs
that children enjoy creating are games, such as Pong, PacMan, Break Out,
Missile Command, etc. They can also create animations, mathematical explorations,
programs that generate sentences, and simulations. Once children have created
their programs, they can share them with others over the Web. ToonTalk
generates Java source code that is equivalent to what a child has created
in ToonTalk. They can then run their program as an applet in a Web browser.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Designed for Children</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>In designing a programming
language specifically for children, care was taken not to diminish the
power of programming. The underlying language of ToonTalk is based upon
years of research by a group of computer scientists at Xerox PARC. Children
master ToonTalk by understanding the program’s equivalents to communication
channels and concurrent process synchronization, such as: birds take messages
to their nests, and robots will wait for something to arrive in a nest
before doing what they are trained to do. Children won’t even realize that
by understanding ToonTalk birds and robots, they are learning how to program.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Pricing and Availability</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>ToonTalk is currently available
on CD-ROM for an introductory price of $49.95. The product is available
by calling 1-800-317-9830 or by visiting <a href="http://www.toontalk.com/">www.toontalk.com</a>.
The CD-ROM includes both a Windows 3.1 and a Windows 95/98/NT version.
A free 30-day trial version is available at <a href="http://www.toontalk.com/">www.toontalk.com</a>.
ToonTalk is also published in Sweden by Ekelunds Forlag AB (<a href="http://www.ekelunds.se/">www.ekelunds.se)</a>
and published in the rest of Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong
Kong, Singapore, India, and Malaysia by Logotron, a division of Addison
Wesley Longman (www.logo.com).</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>About the creator of ToonTalk</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>ToonTalk was created and built
by Ken Kahn, an MIT computer science Ph.D. with over 20 years of experience
in designing programming languages at Xerox PARC and various universities.
In 1992, Kahn left Xerox PARC to found Animated Programs. Kahn received
a patent for animated user interfaces for computer program creation, control,
and execution for the technology underlying ToonTalk.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>About Animated Programs</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Animated Programs, based in
San Mateo, California was founded in 1992 with the mission to make computer
programming child’s play. The company’s first product offering is ToonTalk,
a software program that makes programming fun and easy to learn.</font></font>

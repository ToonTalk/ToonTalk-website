Beta Releases</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Die Information ist zur Zeit nur in Englisch
verf&uuml;gbar</font></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 15 introduces the ability to label nests
and birds by typing while holding them. You can also name a robot by typing
while holding it. You can associate comments with any object by pressing
F8 to stop Marty (and all robots). You can then give Marty something and
he'll ask for something to associate with that object. If you associate
a text pad with an object then Marty will use that text when describing
the object. <a href="remote.htm">Several sensors</a> have been changed
and some new ones added. It now works to put a flipped over picture on
the back of another flipped over picture to give a picture a behavior.
You can now use control-c to copy something to the clipboard and control-v
to paste it into ToonTalk. You can now control how many <a href="command.htm">houses
are on a block</a>. And <a href="bugs.htm">lots of bugs</a> have been fixed.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 14 <a href="bugs.htm#Beta14">mostly
fixes bugs</a>. It supports a new format for putting ToonTalk objects in
the Windows clipboard. This new format should be safe for sending through
email. Beta 14 can read the old format as well but Beta 13 cannot read
ToonTalk objects saved by Beta 14 or later. Beta 14 also changes the meaning
of the visibility remote control for pictures. The setting "SEE SOME" now
make the background (black if a picture imported by a user) transparent.
And the setting "SEE NOTHING" no longer makes pictures that have been added
to the invisible picture invisible as well. Beta 14A <a href="bugs.htm#Beta14A">fixes
several bugs</a>. Beta 14B fixes <a href="bugs.htm#Beta14B">a few more
bugs</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 13 gives you the ability to <a href="robot.htm#ReTraining">re-train
robots</a>. And more <a href="bugs.htm#Beta13">bugs were fixed and small
enhancements added</a>. Beta 13A fixes <a href="bugs.htm#Beta13A">a few
more bugs</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 12 adds a few features for very advanced
users. Robots can now be <a href="robot.htm#MetaProgramming">trained to
manipulate teams of other robots</a>. Thought bubbles can be edited and
teams re-arranged. You can now arrange for any behavior to happen when
<a href="picture.htm#BirdOnTheBack">2 pictures collide</a>. Many bugs were
fixed and minor features have also been added. <a href="bugs.htm#Beta12">Click
here</a> for details.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 11 has two new features. ToonTalk now
supports force feedback joysticks. You can feel force effects when you
use ToonTalk but you will also find <a href="force.htm">a notebook of remote
controls for using force effects</a> in your own programs. There is now
a way to load <a href="extend.htm">extensions into ToonTalk</a>. The only
extension currently defined enables you to read and write files and communication
ports from inside of ToonTalk. As always, <a href="bugs.htm#Beta11">various
bugs</a> were fixed as well. Beta 11A just <a href="bugs.htm#Beta11A">fixes
several bugs</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 10 has updated and improved demos. And
<a href="bugs.htm#Beta10">lots of bugs fixed</a>. Beta 10A <a href="bugs.htm#Beta10A">fixes
even more bugs</a>. (Special thanks to Shelly C. Wallace for reporting
many of them.)</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 9 allows you to decorate houses (the
roof and front wall), rooms (the wall), and cities. All decoration can
have robots on the back and so can be given any behavior you like. You
can now save cities. An automatic trouble-shooting facility was added.
You can now move around on the floor. You can now see what's on the floor
while standing in a room. A new options dialog was added to make it easier
to customize ToonTalk. And of course many <a href="bugs.htm#Beta9">bugs</a>
were fixed. Beta 9A fixed <a href="bugs.htm#Beta9A">a few more bugs</a>.
And Beta 9B fixed <a href="bugs.htm#Beta9B">more bugs</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8 has support for combining "behaviors".
The idea is that you can define a behavior (like chasing, bouncing, and
exploding) as before by placing robots on the back of a picture. Now you
can combine behaviors by putting lots of flipped pictures on the back of
another picture. Check out these <a href="programs.htm#Behaviors">examples
of combining behavior.</a><font size=-2> </font>Beta 8 also has many "synthetic"
pictures in the <i>Pictures </i>notebook now. In addition to the rectangle
that has been in ToonTalk for years, there are now ovals, rounded rectangles,
lines and more.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="bugs.htm#Beta8A">Beta 8A mostly
fixes bugs</a> in Beta 8.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8B adds 9 new puzzles, a much more robust
Java applet maker, and <a href="bugs.htm#Beta8B">some bug fixes</a>. It
also uses a new much more flexible installation program most of whose advantages
are only on the CD-ROM version. The removal of ToonTalk from your computer
is now supported.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 8C now supports joysticks -- but only
the 32-bit version of ToonTalk. You can use <a href="joystick.htm">a joystick
to control the programmer</a> as well as use <a href="joysense.htm">joystick
sensors</a> to build games that use the joystick. The way mouse buttons
are used has changed. The right mouse button now by default turns things
on and off (like space bar), flips pages in notebooks, and turns over pictures,
numbers and text pads. The way <a href="sound.htm">sound effects</a> are
made and used has been changed as well. And <a href="bugs.htm#Beta8C">some
bugs</a> were fixed.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Starting with version 6B there is now <a href="langs.htm">multi-lingual
support</a> and the ability to generate <a href="java.htm">Java applets</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now has a puzzle game starting with
version 4C. You can even <a href="make_pzl.htm">make your own puzzles</a>!</font>

<p><a NAME="Beta11"></a><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk is in beta
testing and is changing all the time. <a href="bugs.htm">Bugs</a> are fixed.
<a href="programs.htm">Neat things </a>are made all the time in ToonTalk.
There are many <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> of how to improve ToonTalk.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It would be great if you helped by <a href="mailto:KenKahn@ToonTalk.com">reporting
bugs</a>, <a href="contrib.htm">contributing neat things</a>, and <a href="ideas.htm">coming
up with ideas</a>.</font>

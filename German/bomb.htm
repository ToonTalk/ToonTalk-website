<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="../bomb.gif" alt="A picture of a bomb" WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="150"></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Inside of <a href="tooly.htm">Tooly</a>, you'll
find a very large stack of bombs. You can pick one up, press any button and it'll blow up
the house you're in. Luckily, you'll make it out OK, though a bit dazed. Tooly makes it
out OK too along with his friends. Other stuff that was in the house got sucked up very
quickly by <a href="dusty.htm">Dusty</a> so you can go to another house and have him spit
those things out. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">You can train <a href="robot.htm">robots</a> to
blow up houses too. See the &quot;Exploding Houses&quot; demo. If you aren't in the house
when it blows up then Dusty isn't there either to save stuff in the house. It's gone for
good. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">If a trained robot on the back of a picture sets
off a bomb, then he'll destroy himself and the whole picture.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Tip.</b> While blowing up houses can be fun, its
main purpose is recycling. If you train robots to do tasks for you and put them in <a href="truck.htm">trucks</a>, then your city might fill up with houses with robots that
have finished doing their work. It is just tidy to have a robot blow up the house when
he's finished doing his job. Computer scientists call this &quot;explicit deallocation of
memory&quot;.</font><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"> </font></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">History of ToonTalk Enhancements and Bug
Fixes - 1999</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here is the list of bugs and enhancements in 1999. &nbsp;
Similar lists for <a href="bugs96.htm">1996</a>, <a href="bugs97.htm">1997</a>, and <a
href="bugs98.htm">1998</a> are available as well. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you already have ToonTalk and want the latest update then

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/4/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture was given a speed while it was in a box then it
    appeared to move out of the box until you tried to pick the box up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture was dropped on the remote control for the looks
    of another picture, then the robots on the back of the dropped picture didn't run. And the
    appropriate sensors didn't notice that the picture was dropped.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/5/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture vacuums up his box, then
    he now is removed from the back of the picture. This is a good way of expressing the
    termination of one behavior on the back of a picture since using a bomb will destroy the
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/10/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to flip a picture over, get out some
    remote controls, flip the picture back over, and add it to some other picture, then when
    he ran the picture was added so that its center is the where the lower left corner should
    be. This bug fixed itself when you pointed to the picture but now won't happen to start
    with.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/23/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to take out the notebook of sensors
    and then drop it back in the main notebook, then sometimes when that robot was running in
    another house it caused a crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Under rare conditions ToonTalk crashed when a sensor was used
    in a house where the user wasn't.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/27/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On some systems dropping a box on a blank number pad caused
    errors. Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you can hear Bammer's hammer make a sound even when
    he was in another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you train a robot to place something on the roof, house,
    or wall decoration the placement and size was not a good default.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots can no longer be named 'fuc' in the American and UK
    version (once a new version of ustt??.dll and uktt??.dll are installed).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you train a robot to drop a picture on a picture, the
    robot now drops the picture by default so that it is centered on the underlying picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nearly 10 warnings or error messages reported by Marty used
    to say &quot;A robot X&quot;, now he says &quot;A robot named Y X&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors in thought bubbles animated when the robot was placed
    on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when thought bubbles have collision detectors in
    them, the robots were not saved quite right. Sometimes all worked fine and sometimes
    strange things happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to pick up the box he was given and
    set it down and then use it, he got confused when running on the back of a picture. Thanks
    to Ross Adamson for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now erase a picture or a remote looks more than one
    time. (Still are other known bugs with remote looks still.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/29/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many changes to remote looks so that it and the picture it
    &quot;controls&quot; are kept in sync better. Especially if the remote is repeatedly
    erased and given a new appearance. Also changes in size of one is reflected in the other
    now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When using Pumpy to make a picture a good size ('G'), the
    size no longer depends upon the history of the size changes to the picture but is a good
    size for that picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to flip pages in a notebook he was
    holding and used shift-click (or right mouse button if enabled) then the robot didn't
    remember the page flips. Thanks to Ross Adamson for pointing this problem out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many more changes to remote looks so that it and the picture
    it &quot;controls&quot; are kept in sync better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots shouldn't work on the front of pictures but by
    pressing 'f' twice very fast they sometimes do. If you save such a picture the robots go
    back to the backside where they belong. Thanks to Lennart Mogren for pointing this out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a city or notebook file has been corrupted (or saved by a
    buggy version of ToonTalk) then sometimes ToonTalk would crash when restarting or page
    flipping. Now the crash is often avoided but the object or city is probably not what it
    should be. Thanks to Miki Grahame for help here.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Still more changes to remote looks so that it and the picture
    it &quot;controls&quot; are kept in sync better.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots were confused when trained to drop a picture on an
    erased picture (to give it a new appearance).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">15/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced a bug where Marty would give a
    spurious warning when flipping over number or text pads.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">16/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where the system would crash
    when shutting down. Caused by erasing pictures and giving them a new appearance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk would crash when saving a box with a picture inside
    with robots working on the back of the picture. Thanks to Kristian Johansson and Stefan
    Sennerö for sending an example of this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A picture of a number in a box would get a zero width if in a
    box that was vacuumed and then spit out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saving a picture while robots were working on the back would
    sometimes fail.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot trained to pick up and drop the box he was given when
    running on the back of a picture would cause the box to disappear.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture had a small or narrow picture on top when
    saved it might have become even smaller or narrower (so much so that it couldn't be seen).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot on the back of a picture used a vacuum
    the system crashed. Thanks to Miki Grahame for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures remember their size when dropped in a box so that
    when you take them out they animate to their previous size. This was broken if you saved a
    city or box with a picture in it.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">18/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved a picture while flipped with robots and boxes on
    the back they became separated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved a picture while flipped then when you took it
    out again and flipped it, its original size was forgotten.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a flipped picture (with robots and boxes that
    contain sensors) on the back of another picture the behavior is transferred correctly.
    When you then removed the flipped picture, it was not restored but continued to control
    the other picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a flipped picture on a flipped picture and the
    picture you dropped had other pictures on top of it (on the front) then when you saved it,
    the sizes were wrong (often so wrong that the pictures appeared to have disappeared
    because they were so short).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with flipping pictures with robots and boxes
    on the back and putting them on the flipside of other pictures. Thanks to Ross Adamson for
    sending an example of this bug.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If robot repeatedly types on a text pad the pad got slightly
    shorter. Thanks to Ross Adamson for sending an example of this bug.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to add things to a remote control for
    the decoration of the roof, house, or room then the changes the robot made while being
    trained actually changed the ToonTalk world. Robots during training are just imagining
    things - this shouldn't change the world and no longer does.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the decorations on the wall of the room became
    resized incorrectly. No longer.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">23/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you had a nest on the back of a picture and copied the
    picture then the bird found the nest OK but if you then made a copy of the copy the bird
    did not deliver anything to the copy. Thanks to Miki Grahame for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied a box with a bird and more than 1 copy of her
    nest then it was not copied correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird and a picture with her nest were both in a box and
    something is given to the bird then she delivered it instantly (without flying).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If used the &quot;colliding with&quot; sensor and you collide
    with a picture of a number or text pad, ToonTalk would sometimes crash. Thanks to Kristian
    Johansson and Stefan Sennerö for sending an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem with robots using the
    magic wand on the back of pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">25/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would often say a notebook was longer that it is really
    is since he would count some blank pages at the end.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/3/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some actions and animations happened in zero time when the
    power was off (F8).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/3/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several round off errors including one that caused some
    remote controls of a picture that is part of another picture to not accept a change of the
    width to 0 but changed it back to 1 (or even 2 sometimes).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now pick up a robot and type a new name for him.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way the name of a robot is displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can pick up a bird and type text for her t-shirt.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can pick up a nest and type a label for the nest. If you
    add the label to a nest with an egg in it then the bird will have the same label when she
    hatches.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now give any object to a bird to put on her t-shirt.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Disabled the keyboard shortcuts for dropping things ('D' or
    'd') since interferes with giving labels. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Comments can be added to any object. F8 (power off) now stops
    Marty from flying around (he still will give help). You can now give him 2 things and
    he'll associate the first with the second. If the second item is a text pad, he'll use
    that text when describing the first item. Otherwise he'll describe the second item when
    describing the first. You can get a copy of a comment by giving Marty a commented object.
    This is particularly useful if the second object is a sound recording you wish to play.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new internal file format (version 9). Old
    versions can still be loaded and will be saved in the new version. This means that
    anything saved in version 1.1 (or Beta 15) or later cannot be loaded into an earlier
    version of ToonTalk. The new file format features:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Correct saving of nests that have been copied.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Comments are saved.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User provided names for robots are saved.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Labels for nests (and birds too but that is via the older
        t-shirt scheme) are saved.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures are saved in a more concise manner.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The number of extensions (birds that fly off to DLLs) was
        increased from 255 to 64K.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The number of nests that can be saved at once increased from
        255 to the limit of your machine's memory.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The color and visibility (see all, see some, see none) of
        text pads is now saved.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/4/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you would get a warning in your log file that there
    wasn't enough memory for the next sound and yet there was. This would often cause sounds
    not be heard thereafter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a robot was trained to take box containing
    a picture of non-picture and then that picture was erased then the robot would only accept
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where sometimes a bird would
    fly off when going between 2 places on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a performance bug when there are lots of things on the
    floor that are off screen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/5/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User pictures (created by the &quot;File to Picture&quot;
    sensor) saved the full path name for the BMP file. This interfered with sharing things
    with other machines that may have installed ToonTalk on a different directory or drive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes user pictures had a black line on the top or on the
    right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/8/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now give your notebooks titles. These show up on the
    bottom of the notebook. This required yet another file format change to save the titles.
    &nbsp; Just start typing when holding the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The notebook of remote controls of a picture now shows the
    picture on the bottom of the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a scale had a nest to its right then the scale would
    totter causing a robot to give up on matching when he should have (and now does) waited
    for something to appear on the nest. Thanks to Richard Noss and Celia Hoyles for providing
    an example of this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot will now accept a box with a tottering scale if he
    has a tottering scale at the same place in the box in his thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Scales now compare pictures as well as text and number. User
    pictures are compared by the alphabetic order of the file names. User pictures are
    &quot;heavier&quot; than built in pictures. Built in pictures are compared by an internal
    index comparison.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now drop a picture on a nest to cover it up.
    (Previously you needed to give it to the nest's bird to accomplish this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/9/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in using scales to compare user pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you picked up a wand and kept typing numbers strange
    numbers appeared once the wand counter exceeded 2**31 (about 2 billion). Now the wand
    counter disappears (since it is &quot;infinite&quot;). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now rubout a wand counter to get rid of it. Thanks to
    Miki Grahame for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a truck built a house but wasn't being watched
    (e.g. you just walked into another house), the house was built at a crazy location -
    sometimes off the ToonTalk island. This could lead to other problems later.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/10/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the geometry of pictures that are parts
    of other pictures when saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the location of pictures that are parts
    of other pictures when the picture is flipped and saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where pictures on pictures were confused
    where they were (so for example sounds were not heard).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Did a much better fix of the problem with user pictures that
    sometimes black lines appeared at the top or the sides.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User pictures can now be scaled more the 256 times and
    reduced to less than 1/256 of the original size.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/12/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a nest was on the back of a picture and that picture was
    put in a notebook then every time a copy of the picture was obtained from the notebook
    then copies of the nest were made in such a way that a bird thought all the copies were
    her nest (and she copied herself and what she was given and flew to all the nests). This
    no longer happens if the original of the copy is part of a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">An empty nest now only matches empty nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If no members of a team of robots matched a box given to
    them, but some sensors were involved then it used to be that the final robot would wait
    for a change. Now it is the first robot in the team to try to match against a sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Matching against an empty nest also follows the new rule
    above. I.e. it is treated the same as matching against a sensor since in both cases the
    values can change independent of the team of robots working on that box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot tried to match a value against a nest, it waited
    until something arrived on the nest. Now an earlier member of the team of robots will wait
    if he is the first to fail to match due to sensors or nest matching.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would sometimes say there were some number of objects
    on the flipside of a picture when there was really one less than the number he gave.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/16/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a box on the back of a picture was lost
    when a robot picked it up and dropped it. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/24/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed 2 bugs that caused boxes to sometimes disappear from
    the back of pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk crashed if a bird is returning to a
    picture with a nest on the back that has been dropped onto a notebook.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/25/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several bugs where boxes or robots that were on the
    back of a picture that was on the back of another picture moved to the back of the
    containing picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where you would see a bird flying when both
    the bird and nest were on the back of the same picture (but at different levels).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving a city while birds were flying around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk crashed if Marty needed more than
    20,000 characters to describe something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty tried to describe a flipped
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/26/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture set down a nest with an
    egg in it then the bird ended up on the floor instead of on the back of the picture where
    the robot can use it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots on the back of pictures now do much less work. Since
    they accomplish as much and aren't being watched no one knows.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/27/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where things that change when dropped (e.g. a
    nest with an egg) didn't work properly on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes robot's lost the name a user
    game then and reverted to their generated name.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/28/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when saving a city with a notebook open to
    the remote looks of something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the geometry of the remote looks of a flipped
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/39/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where if a puzzle included a notebook, then it
    crashed if the notebook is dropped. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting this one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the floor was saved via F6 and a copy of Tooly was on the
    floor, then Tooly did not appear when the puzzle was run.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the order of pictures was not displayed correctly.
    One symptom was that sometimes in puzzles you could see ### on top rather than below some
    picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the goal of a picture isn't rectangular you could see ###
    underneath. No longer. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/30/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a player does a sequence of user puzzles (not the built-in
    ones) then the log file wasn't replayable. To replay a log that ran on user puzzles
    currently can only be done by adding &quot;-puzzle &lt;file name&gt; -I &lt;log file
    name&gt;&quot; to the ToonTalk icon or running it from a shell. Thanks to Lennart for
    sending an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture contained a picture than contained a picture
    then ToonTalk crashed when you tried to flip it over. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for
    reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you give a bird a picture that isn't rectangular (or a
    scale) then the nest underneath disappeared. Now you can see the entire stack. The issue
    of whether Marty should still talk about pictures being rectangular when their visibility
    is set to &quot;See some&quot; is still an open question. Thanks to Miki for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty got mixed up talking about a box containing a notebook
    (other than one that started off being the blank notebook). When such a box was placed in
    a robot's thought bubble, then ToonTalk crashed when Marty described the robot. Thanks to
    Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;picture #&quot; sensor behaved strangely for user
    pictures (created by &quot;File to Picture&quot;). Thanks to Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to pick something from a stack and
    then returns it to the stack, then he didn't run well on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you take things off a nest and set them down after a few
    of them that work fine, you used to find that you couldn't pick back up the things you set
    down. Thanks to Miki for reporting this.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/31/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now add -houses &lt;n&gt; to the command line to
    control how many houses are on a block. The number can be between 1 and at least 255.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a sensor that has a clear numeric value on a
    number then it is added as if it were that number. Addresses work this way now. Also
    sensors whose value is &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; have the value 1 and 0
    respectively.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a robot in another house drops something on
    an erased box. Thanks to P.A. Dreyfuss for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/1/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you save a city (or a floor in making a puzzle)
    with pictures that are active (i.e. robots are running on the back) then they now run when
    restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you drop a picture with robots on the back with
    the power off then the picture runs when the power is restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now use control-c to copy what is in your
    hand to the Windows clipboard and control-v to paste what is on the clipboard onto the
    floor. Robots can be trained to do this as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When you save a city it now saves the &quot;number
    of houses to a block&quot; parameter as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed various bugs that can cause user created
    puzzles to crash (these were due to the fact that some code expected Tooly the Toolbox to
    be around and he often isn't in puzzles). Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed some geometry problems with large numbers of
    houses to a block</font><font SIZE="2" face="Comic Sans MS">.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/2/99</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Extended the format of puzzle files to include user
    defined robots that can accept or reject answers. See <a

    for details.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added <a href="ttini.htm#GeneralTextToSpeechEngine">a

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/7/99</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where nests didn't display their labels.
    (Introduced on 3/31/99.) Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added two new sensors to the notebook of sensors for
    a picture -- <a href="remote.htm#Parts">Parts</a> and <a href="remote.htm#Containers">Containers</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you vacuumed up the remote control for the looks
    of a picture that was on the floor then that picture became very narrow.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if you grabbed a working robot, you got a
    spurious warning from Marty about the robot being confused.</font></li>

<title>ToonTalk, a game-like animated world for doing computer programming, released</title>

<p><b>For Immediate Release</b></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Release of ToonTalk, </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>a game-like animated world for
computer programming.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>ToonTalk is a completely new,
patented way of constructing, debugging, and running programs.</b></font>

<dir>
  <li><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk programs are not constructed by typing any
    text. Nor are they constructed by assembling pictures. They are built by taking actions in
    an interactive animated world. The programmer is a character in this world and can fly a
    helicopter, enter houses, train robots, give birds messages to deliver, use animated
    tools, and much more in the process of constructing, testing, debugging, and running
    programs. The underlying technology received U.S. Patent 5,517,663.</font></li>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>ToonTalk includes a game that
teaches children computer programming in a new and fun way.</b></font>

<dir>
  <li><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Besides including many narrated programming
    demonstrations and a character who can give users spoken help and advice, ToonTalk
    includes a new way of learning programming - by playing a game. In the game, players
    volunteer to help an injured Martian repair his spaceship. To do so they need to solve a
    sequence of interactive puzzles that gradually introduce programming constructs and
    techniques. Most of the 50 fourth graders who tested the game enjoyed it and quickly
    proceeded to build many programs. For example, after an hour or so they had, without any
    help, constructed a program to build a data structure containing 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on up
    to 1,073,741,824.</font></li>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>ToonTalk is a powerful
programming language that even 6-year-olds have mastered.</b></font>

<dir>
  <li><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">In designing a programming language for children,
    care was taken not to diminish the power and expressiveness of the language due to its
    concrete and animated syntax. ToonTalk's model of computation is based upon years of
    research by a group of computer scientists led by the author at Xerox PARC. Children
    master ToonTalk not by understanding about communication channels and concurrent process
    synchronization, but by understanding the ToonTalk equivalents: that birds take messages
    to their nests, and that robots will wait for something to arrive in a nest before doing
    what they were trained to do.</font></li>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>ToonTalk was built by Ken Kahn,
an MIT computer science Ph.D. with over 20 years of experience in designing programming
languages at Xerox PARC and various universities.</b></font>

<dir>
  <li><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">In 1992, Kahn left Xerox PARC to found Animated
    Programs, whose mission is to make computer programming child's play. Kahn did all the
    design and programming himself at his home, and sought out other one or two person
    home-based companies to provide needed services including animation, voice talent, audio
    recording, and legal assistance. Besides contracting with a software-testing lab, he has
    received tremendous help from hundreds of volunteer beta testers for over 3 years.</font></li>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>ToonTalk is the basis of a
3-year, 4-country, million-dollar European research project.</b></font>

<dir>
  <li><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The Playground project began on November 1, 1998. It
    will iteratively design and evaluate computational playgrounds where children aged 4-8 can
    play and create their own games using tactile, oral, and physical means of expressing the
    rules. Playgrounds will be built upon ToonTalk and Logo. The project consists of a
    consortium of partners from the UK, Portugal, Sweden, and Slovakia, both academic and
    commercial, with complementary expertise in computer science, educational research and
    development, and young children's learning. See <a href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground">www.ioe.ac.uk/playground</a>

<p><font size="6">While ToonTalk is a visual (or more accurately an animated) programming
language, it can be customized to make it easier for someone who is visually impaired to
use it.</font></p>

<p><font size="6">In &quot;Free Play&quot; mode that there is a bike pump tool named <a href="pumpy.htm">Pumpy</a> that can be used to make any object bigger. There is a
character named <a href="marty.htm">Marty</a> who plays the role of a coach and guide. He
also provides help and error reporting. If you add &quot;-l 150&quot; to <a href="command.htm">the command line</a> then the size of the letters in his talk balloon
will increase by 50%. Or you can set this in &quot;Free Play&quot; by going to <a href="options.HTM">the notebook on page 10</a> of your main ToonTalk notebook and going to
page 16.</font></p>

<p><font size="6">There is also an option which controls the speed that the talk balloons
change. When you start ToonTalk select &quot;Set Options&quot; and answer the question
about talk balloons with the choice that makes the balloons stay up until you hit the
&quot;PageDown&quot; button.</font></p>

<p><font size="6">In &quot;Free Play&quot; you can choose between three houses. Each one
has a different color floor and you might find it easier to see things with a contrasting
background color.</font></p>

<p><font size="6">If you have the CD-ROM version of ToonTalk and are running the 32-bit
version of ToonTalk then you can make Marty speak. Or if you have a text-to-speech engine
installed on your machine that complies with Microsoft's Speech API (and most do) then you
can use it in ToonTalk if you edit the <a href="ttini.htm">toontalk.ini file</a> on your
windows directory so that line</font></p>

<p><font size="6">TextToSpeechMode=</font></p>

<p><font size="6">is changed to give the name of the voice you want. For example,</font></p>

<p><font size="6">TextToSpeechMode=Fred</font></p>

<p><font size="6">It is also possible to <a href="command.htm#FontChange">change the fonts</a>
that ToonTalk uses.</font></p>

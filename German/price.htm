<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are sometimes asked why ToonTalk costs $49.95 (in the
North and South America and much of Asia) when many excellent software titles for children
cost about half that. If ToonTalk were simply a game, its price would be much less. If
ToonTalk were simply a tutoring program that teaches computer programming concepts, its
price would be much less. But ToonTalk is a game, a tutor, and a <em>tool</em>.&nbsp; And
programming tools usually cost much more than $49.95. </font></p>

Thanks for coming to help me fix the ship.
OK, first we'll need to fix the ship's computer.
It'll need numbers to work.  Can you please go into the house
next door and return with a box with 1 and 2 in it?
If you ever have any problems, come back over here and I'll try to help you.

Use mouse buttons to
sit, pick up, and drop.
We need #######.

This is the result of saving everything in a room.

The following is a box with 2 holes whose first hole contains the number
1 and whose second hole contains the number 2

NumberTyping = off
TextTyping = off
Flipping = off
FunctionKeys = off

Did you notice that you can pick up numbers and let
go of them over holes in the box?

Just sit down in the other room and put the numbers in the box.  Then
pick up the box and press 'Escape' (the button labeled 'Esc' in the upper corner of your keyboard) to bring it back here.

OK.  Here's what I'd do if I could.  I'd pick up the 1 and drop it in the
first hole.  Then I'd pick up the 2 and drop it in the second hole.  Then
I'd grab the whole box and carry it back.

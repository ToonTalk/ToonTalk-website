<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk can produce a Java applet from a ToonTalk
program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The interface to translate something to a Java
applet is to pick it up, hit pause, then click on &quot;Save It, Make Java 
Applet, and Show Web Page&quot;. You have
metaphorically moved something from ToonTalk and it is now in Windows. If all goes well a
browser will be launched and you will see your program running. To try this yourself go to
the examples notebook on page 6 and pick up the robot that repeatedly adds 1 on page 2.
Hit pause and click on come back later. When the applet appears in your web browser click
&quot;Start&quot; and watch the number grow. Only robots, trucks, and pictures will
generate a Java applet if held while suspending ToonTalk. A robot will be run with a box
like the one it was trained with. When loading up the truck, you may need to press F8 to
stop it from driving off. You can put a text pad in the truck to name the applet. If you
want your robots to use a special notebook, you'll have to put a copy of the notebook in
the truck. To name an applet generated from a picture (typically with robots on the back)
just add a text pad to the back of the picture. (Text pads longer than 31 characters are
interpreted as a comment - names must be less than 32 characters.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">An applet can query the user for values. If you
translate to Java something with a <a href="bird.htm">nest</a> in a <a href="box.htm">box</a>
(and the <a href="bird.htm">bird</a> for that nest isn't also being translated to Java)
and you have given the nest a label or have put a label under the hole, then when the Java
applet needs a value and finds the nest it will ask the user for the value by printing the
label. Similarly if a bird is labeled or in a labeled hole and is given something then the
label is printed along with a description of the thing given to the bird. The idea is that
birds and nests are being used for communicating to and from the user of a Java applet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">This facility requires a Java-enabled 
browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher or Netscape Navigator 4.0 or
higher (available from <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">www.netscape.com</a>). </font></p>

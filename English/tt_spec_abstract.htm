		<blockquote>
			<p>ToonTalk is a child-oriented programming language whose 
			environment is an animated virtual world, with objects that children 
			can pick up and use as in a game, such as birds, trucks, and robots, 
			providing direct child-oriented metaphors for programming 
			constructs. Actions performed by a programmer's avatar with these 
			objects are both code and coding. ToonTalk is a powerful system, not 
			just a &quot;toy&quot; system: it is based upon concurrent constraint 
			programming languages, and programs written in languages such as 
			Flat Guarded Horn Clauses and Flat Concurrent Prolog can be 
			straight-forwardly constructed in ToonTalk. However, there is not a 
			specification of ToonTalk, for ready implementation in other 
			environments. We propose that the ToonTalk language lies not in the 
			animations displayed by the current environment, but on the actions 
			performed by the programmer with virtual world objects; we present a 
			description and analysis of the methods the ToonTalk language 
			provides to programmers for expressing programs.</p>

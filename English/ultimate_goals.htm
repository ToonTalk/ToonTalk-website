<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">At our dinner the question came up of what are our 
ultimate goals in designing the ideal programming language for children (and 
other learners). One answer is that we want to give kids (and as wide a 
collection of them as possible) the power to express themselves computationally. 
Alan Kay expressed it well

here</a>. We want a language that is truly general purpose and not based upon a 
limited special-purpose computation model. Or maybe the goal shouldn't be a 
single programming language but
<a href="many_languages.htm">
a collection of languages</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides giving children the ability to express 
themselves in fundamentally new and powerful ways, we also want to give them 
objects to think and learn with. And give them new mathematically interesting
<a href="design_aesthetics.htm">
objects to think about as well</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time permitting the following will also be included:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Enhanced <a href="ldbird.htm">long-distance birds</a>.</strong>
    Long-distance birds are useful in version 2 but there are several limitations. In version
    3 we expect birds to be able to find nests that have been moved or copied to other
    machines. Also a bird will be able to deliver messages even if her nest is not currently
    loaded into a ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>MP3 playback.</strong> ToonTalk currently can
    playback Windows Wave files. We plan to add the ability to play MP3 files and maybe other
    compressed audio files.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And maybe version 3 will include some enhancements suggested
by ToonTalk users. If you have suggestions, please <a href="mailto:support@toontalk.com">let
us know</a>. </font></p>

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/27</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way pictures are copied.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now deals better with very small 
  things (e.g. things in boxes in thought bubbles in boxes in other boxes and so 
  on).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading scales saved in XML.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dealing with saving empty text 
  pads in XML. (Rubbed out not erased.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of sensors that display 
  non-rectangular pictures.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you switch to saving in XML, visit an old 
  format city, and then save, the old city file was deleted. It is now renamed 
  to have the extension &quot;octy&quot;. Similarly for notebook files &quot;bok&quot; is renamed &quot;obok&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving in XML notebooks that have 
  never been opened (e.g. inside of another notebook).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flip over the remote control for the 
  looks of a picture you see the notebook of sensors for the picture flies out. 
  If the notebook was already on the floor in another house (or on the floor and 
  you are training a robot in a thought bubble) then the notebook did not 
  appear.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to flip over more than 
  one copy of the remote control for the look then the robot sometimes got 
  confused about whether there was one or two notebooks accessible and would 
  sometimes stop. Thanks to Ylva for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes when robots are 
  running on the back of a picture that is flipped over and then flipped again 
  that its size changes to the size it had while flipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk (or Marty) would 
  describe a team of robots and skip some numbers. (E.g. &quot;the first robot 
  followed by the third robot&quot;). Thanks to Gordon and Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading an untrained robot that 
  had been saved in XML where its thought bubble is in the wrong place.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug triggered by 
  copying a robot that has nothing in his thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if you interrupt the 
  replay of a demo and click on &quot;Take Over&quot; that ToonTalk didn't always start up 
  again. Sometimes you needed to minimize and then open it again.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/29</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk would convert a bird to a 
  long-distance bird unnecessarily. E.g. if Bammer smashed something that 
  contained a bird but didn't contain her nest then ToonTalk would freeze the 
  first time in the session while it initializes the network connections.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of the result of 
  loading a picture when ToonTalk can't find the file defining its appearance. 
  Previously it was a text pad but now it is a picture with text on top. XML 
  only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you load a picture with a missing file, you 
  can now save it again it will be saved as it once was not as it currently 
  appears since the file can't be loaded. XML only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now load picture saved in XML where the 
  file defining its appearance has changed dimensions since it was saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you load a picture that had been created 
  with a full path name (e.g. by drag and drop) and the file is missing then 
  ToonTalk would look in the FileSearchPath for a file of the same name. However 
  it only used the value of MissingPictureFileExtension for the extension even 
  if the original path had a different extension. Now ToonTalk checks first for 
  the original extension and failing that uses the default set by 
  MissingPictureFileExtension.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored an optimization that sometimes greatly 
  speeds up flipping through a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed additional problems saving and restoring 
  scales in XML. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where 
  sometimes the robot's name was not on his chest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes text pads in boxes when changed no 
  longer fit into the hole. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/30</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on&nbsp; 1/17 where 
  ToonTalk might crash or act odd when replaying a demo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 1/26 where when 
  flipping through a notebook when blank pages are reached ToonTalk displayed 
  the contents of the previous pages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug saving a 
  notebook in the main notebook in XML. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when training a robot with a sensor 
  for the looks of a picture, the robot would be trained with a copy of the 
  picture and sometimes with a sensor for the looks. Now it always is a picture. 
  Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when training a robot with the remote 
  looks of a picture that has been flipped the robot was trained with the wrong 
  side of the picture. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When training a robot with the remote looks of 
  a picture that has other pictures on top those pictures were lost during 
  training.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes saving in XML a city 
  where a sensor of the parts of a picture was in use. Thanks to Yishay for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released version 2.75<span lang="en-gb"> and 
  Beta 38.</span></font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="Beta 39">2/5</a></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem triggered by the clipboard 
  having text with a ; that is not followed by a space. (Caused problems parsing 
  to see if text pad is a sequence of numeric operations.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem loading 
  notebooks with notebooks inside.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of things removed 
  from the back of a remote control for the looks of something. Undid this fixed 
  on 2/12 since applied too widely and caused text pads to change size after 
  being pumped up or down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem that made 
  it hard to vacuum out the box in a robot's thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now exits (rather than crash) if the 
  DLL with the language-specific strings is missing. As before a dialog box 
  reports the problem first.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/7</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems caused by boxes with more than 
  32K holes. Some display and selection problems remain to be fixed. Boxes can 
  now have as many holes as memory permits with a limit of 2^31-1.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Boxes with more than 64K holes can be saved in 
  XML. If <a href="ttini.htm#SaveInXML">SaveInXML</a>=0 then boxes will be saved 
  as if they had at most 64K holes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occurred sometimes loading 
  a city with running robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading cities saved in XML 
  where Bammer the Mouse is running out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading cities saved in XML 
  where robots were running and you were standing in the room.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/8</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading a city saved in XML 
  when a robot had been trained with a box that was subsequently destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a city in XML when a 
  house was created by a truck crew and then the robot in the truck was 
  destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caused sometimes by vacuuming 
  up a flipped picture and its notebook of remote controls.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed a spurious warning caused when a bird 
  is flying to her nest and the nest is not in a room (e.g. is in a truck that 
  is driving).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem when a bird flies from the 
  floor to another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where 
  sometimes items on the page of a notebook were the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the placement of items on notebook 
  pages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a picture and its remote 
  control were both flipped over and then the notebooks vacuumed up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced memory leak of the 
  things on a floor when a house is blown up by a robot (out of sight).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem sometimes caused when
  <a href="ttini.htm#MaximumItemsInDusty">MaximumItemsInDusty</a> had been set.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some recently introduced rare problems 
  copying things.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem when a text pad is bammed 
  with another off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem copying a robot when the 
  contents of its thought bubble was connected with other items (e.g. bird/nest 
  or sensor/picture) outside of the thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the toontalk.ini switch
  <a href="ttini.htm#MinimumTimeSample">MinimumTimeSample</a>. This controls how 
  accurate the millisecond timer is. The default value is 1. If, for example, it 
  is set to 10 then the timer has 10 millisecond accuracy. On a few systems this 
  may speed up ToonTalk. If set to 0 or a negative value, leaves the system 
  default set by Microsoft Windows. Note that you should set this to 0 to run on 
  an Apple Macintosh running VirtualPC. (Default was incorrectly set until 
  2/14.)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a bird flies out of a

  when a bird has temporarily removed the stack of things on her nest to put a 
  new item on the bottom.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a bird is flying to her 
  nest and the nest is in a truck that is driving off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a bird would fly from the 
  floor in the wrong direction to deliver something to another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the notebook of the
  <a href="ttini.htm#DefaultUser">DefaultUser</a> wasn't reconstructed correctly 
  if it had been saved in XML.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem saving 
  teams of more than 2 robots in XML where they didn't know about each other. 
  Dropping the team corrected the problem.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/13</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem caused by loading a city 
  where objects were animating in certain ways.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the range of the random 
  number sensor was 0 to 1000 inclusive immediately after it was copied. It now 
  is always 0 to 999.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added the command line alternative
  <a href="command.htm#DefaultUser">-default_user</a> to the toontalk.ini
  <a href="ttini.htm#DefaultUser">DefaultUser</a> option. This way an icon can 
  have a different default user than the other icons.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/21</font></p>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If using the new scheme that maintains a 
  private directory of media then imported sounds have the short file name not 
  the full path.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something goes wrong while generating a 
  snapshot then ToonTalk no longer crashes - just the file isn't created.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of missing files when 
  using the new media scheme.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes sensors left on 
  the floor in a saved city didn't work right when restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored a feature that has been broken since 
  ToonTalk began supporting fractions and large numbers. You can once again drop

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes notebooks were restored with pages 
  inactive even though the page contents were active when dropped on the 
  notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where user pictures didn't copy 
  correctly when the new media directory is enabled. The file name was lost and 
  black was replaced by near black so that the SEE SOME setting of the 
  visibility sensor had no effect.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk crashed if you tried 
  to generate a Java applet of something containing pictures whose image files 
  couldn't be found.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copies of pictures created with version 2.83 
  through 2.87 caused ToonTalk crashes - they are now repaired as best as 
  possible by turning them into colored rectangles. The image file name has been 
  lost so not much more can be done.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copies of the random number generator now 
  typically display different numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a house was blown up with a 
  notebook of remote controls for a picture on the floor then ToonTalk crashed 
  when Dusty spits things out or became &quot;full&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a truck was driving into a house while you 
  fly from a side view to a view from above then the robots weren't placed in 
  the house. Bug was introduced 12/26/02.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you visited a city saved in XML then your 
  language setting was reset to that the city had when it was saved. No longer 
  changes the language.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The way XML was put into zip archives did not 
  restore correctly non-ASCII characters such as those in Sweden and Portuguese. 
  Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you made a Java applet twice in the same 
  session and your program included a notebook then ToonTalk crashed. Thanks to 
  Ylva for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk's random number generator was not very 
  random. In particular every other number was odd and even. Thanks to Gordon 
  for providing an example of this.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that prevented the wiggling 
  feedback from occurring sometimes when holding something over a number or text 
  pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made improvements to how ToonTalk handles user 
  pictures (though introduced a bug fixed on 4/28 that caused copying of user 
  pictures to appear to lose transparency). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caused when something has been 
  copied by the Magic Wand using O (for original) and then the object is flipped 
  while still attached to the wand.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird and nest are in a vacuum and the city 
  is saved the bird is converted to a long-distance bird unnecessarily thereby 
  wasting resources and time. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem retraining a robot that drops 
  something on an erased box. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In various situations robots were doing 
  significantly more work than necessary when off screen. And if they were 
  running on the back of a picture then when the picture was flipped over the 
  size and location of items was sometimes distorted. Thanks to Gordon for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 4/14 related to 
  transparency of copies of user pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Scales now totter even if they are on a nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where Pumpy can make things so 
  narrow they disappear. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if you are holding a text or 
  number pad or a synthetic picture (e.g. a rectangle) and select the new 'Edit 
  Picture' option where ToonTalk stopped until you minimized and then maximized 
  it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.91</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/29</font></p>

  rectangle) when an invisible object is selected or held. Thanks to Leonel for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot terminates abnormally the team 
  didn't always re-form correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copy a file in the Windows Explorer 
  (with control-c or by selecting copy from the right-click menu) then you now 
  can paste it into ToonTalk even if the file is a picture or sound. Previously 
  only worked for files containing ToonTalk clippings or text files. Thanks to 
  Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more time travel bugs.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the time travel

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a team 
  of robots on the back of a picture saved in earlier versions of ToonTalk were

  providing an example of this.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when

<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made a major change to how 
  things are stored in XML when one thing refers to another (e.g. a bird to her 
  nest or a sensor to its picture). The new format allows for parts of a city to 
  be loaded independently.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The new XML format fixes

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time travel&nbsp; data is 
  both smaller and much faster to record than before. Significantly increases 
  the range of situations where time travel is practical. (If the computer is

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time travel archives can now

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some parts of ToonTalk

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When saving an application 
  ToonTalk generates a snapshot picture. The one that was in BMP format is now 
  deleted. (And in 2.99j only the PNG version of the snapshot was available only 
  in the TT file.)</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of 
  media files in time travel archives. Among these is that ToonTalk no longer 
  spends any effort trying to further compress files such as JPG, PNG, and GIF 
  that are already compressed.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/7</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented a significant 
  optimization in time travel archive playback that eliminates most pauses.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When replaying another's 
  time travel archive ToonTalk now shows the elapsed time rather than the 
  absolute time for each segment.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/7</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk once again leaves a 
  snapshot of your application in the user directory called snapshot.png when 
  you save what is your hand.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now uses
  <a href="ttini.htm#MaximumNumberOfTimeLines">MaximumNumberOfTimeLines</a> when 
  time travelling to keep a limited number of old time lines generated when you 
  go back into the past and change things (begin recording over the old

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems caused

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/8</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The XML file format now 
  supports the saving of everything on the floor, entire houses, or the whole 
  city to the clipboard. Typing control-c with an empty hand will save 
  everything on the floor. Control-c while standing a room will save the house 
  and control-c while outside will save the city. Control-v can be used to paste 
  everything on the floor on to a floor. Control-v while walking will paste a 
  house nearby. </font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced 
  bug jumping to the next time travel log segment.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now stops speaking 
  soon after beaming out. This is particularly useful if he was in the middle of 
  saying a very long sentence - e.g. describing a very large number. </font>
  </span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty tried to say a 
  number with more than 100 digits he read it in base 32 rather than decimal.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs using the 
  functions &quot;Integer Part&quot;, &quot;Fraction Part&quot;, &quot;Denominator&quot;, and &quot;Numerator&quot; on 
  floating point numbers. ToonTalk creates floating point numbers as 
  approximations when you use a trigonometric function or compute the root of a 
  number. Otherwise the numbers are exact rational numbers. Thanks to Amelie for 
  reporting this.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the 
  display of some built-in functions like &quot;Integer Part&quot; displayed as &quot;Integer 
  Part1.5&quot;.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced 
  problem that caused an error when trying to report an error.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you press Pause and time 
  travel is enabled you get the time travel interface. Pressing Pause again 
  brings you to the old pause dialog. Returning to ToonTalk now returns to the 
  time travel interface.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The code for the XML file

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem undoing 
  Bammer when pictures with pictures on top were involved. Thanks to Amelie for 
  reporting this.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a few problems with 
  displaying numbers that included temporarily displaying digits beyond the 
  edges of the number pad. Thanks to Amelie for reporting this.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk responded strangely 
  if you typed digits while holding a built-in unary function such as 'Sine'. 
  Thanks to Amelie for reporting this.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The results of applying the 
  functions 'Integer Part', 'Denominator', and 'Numerator' are exact integers 
  but didn't always display that way. In particular when applied to a floating 
  point number the result was grey.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a text pad on an 
  erased number pad ToonTalk will try to make a number from the text pad. It now 
  handles many more cases (e.g. fractions and decimals).</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying 
  an inexact number that had previously had a value that had been displayed as 
  shrinking digits. (E.g. computing the square root of 1/3.)</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving and then 
  restoring the current value of a numeric sensor. This made some speed sensors 
  be restored with a value of zero.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal much better with 
  floating point number exceptions (e.g. infinity and non-a-number). Thanks to 
  Amelie for reporting this.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer creates 
  files in the user's directory for built-in notebooks unless they have been 
  altered.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bammer will respond only to 
  number pads dropped on text pads when the number pad contains an integer.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that 
  occurred as ToonTalk tried to report an error when an erased number pad was 
  dropped on a text pad.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/8</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Numeric sensors display 
  right justified - that is ToonTalk inserts spaces before the number when 
  appropriate. This is no longer limited to dealing with values that require 4 
  digits. E.g. the display of the random number generator multiplied by 1000. 
  Thanks to Amelie for reporting this.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stood up while 
  holding a tool such as Dusty or Pumpy then sat down they wouldn't select 
  anything until dropped and picked up again. Thanks to Amelie for reporting

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem pasting 
  where inappropriate sharing occurred. </font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pressed alt-tab while 
  running the puzzle game in full screen the dialog screen gave you the option 
  of saving the city. But a city saved while running puzzles didn't load 
  properly. You no longer have the button for saving in this case. Thanks to 
  Amelie for reporting this.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/8</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made major improvements to

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a sensor for the width or 
  height of a picture is set to a negative value it is reset to zero. Previously 
  it was reset to the absolute value of the negative value.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Since January if you trained 
  a robot to flip to a page in the main notebook then when the robot ran a 
  second time he would start where he left off the previous time. This was a 
  mistake and the robot now starts at the beginning each time. Thanks to Amelie

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem training a

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ToonTalk option screen

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/8</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the clipboard sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Greatly sped up saving cities, time travel 
  archives, or objects with large number of media files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The generated XML now declares the correct

  vowels).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/8</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more time travel replay bugs including 
  one triggered by leaving things on the ground and another by having a tool 
  select a page in a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The overhead of saving cities while recording 
  for time travel is no longer included in the timing for when to make new time 
  travel segments. So ToonTalk doesn't stop if it takes more time to save a city 
  than is allocated between time travel log segments.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the <a href="ttini.htm#GenerateLogs">
  GenerateLogs</a> toontalk.ini switch is set to a negative value then old logs

</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">29/8</font></span></p>
<ol>

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where 
  sometimes keyboard and mouse events that happen exactly at the border between 
  time travel segments were ignored.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling 
  when loading XML where objects incorrectly refer to other objects. (Hopefully 
  ToonTalk is no longer generating such files anyway.)</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">30/8</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where when

  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way notebooks 
  are saved in XML when a city is saved.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that sometimes 
  prevent you from moving around on the ground outside.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where 
  sometimes very large objects in a room switched from being in front or behind 
  other things (including the programmer when he or she stands up.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added the command line 
  option <a href="command.htm#SecondsBetweenLogs">-seconds_between_logs </a>so 
  icons can be customized as to whether they time travel is enabled and if so 
  how frequently.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The synthetic shapes 
  (rectangles, circles, etc.) use an older Windows API that is limited to a 
  maximum size 32,767 pixels. Large images are now limited to that size rather 
  than causing errors.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">31/8</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes things went wrong 
  in time travel replay on the first frame of the segment.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If an error occurs while 
  replaying a time travel segment ToonTalk recovers better now and typically can 
  just skip that segment without problem.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes sounds were 
  stopped by time travel.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that sometimes 
  caused errors when pressing F11 to undo the most recent things smashed by 
  Bammer the Mouse.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem restoring 
  cities saved in XML containing the clipboard sensor.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where saving 
  notebooks slowed down time travel - sometimes significantly.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a 
  picture is saved while being flipped then it sometimes gets the wrong size.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now deals better 
  with saving things without also saving things they depend upon. E.g. a sensor 
  and not the picture it is sensing.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with naming 
  files in Windows 95, 98 and Me. Windows 2000 and XP didn't have the problem.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems putting 
  fractional numbers on the clipboard and then pasting them back into to 
  ToonTalk. Did not occur if the numbers were in something (e.g. a box).</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text pads now display tabs 
  correctly.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The undocumented feature of 
  typing control-i to make infinite stacks of things has been changed so you 
  need to type control-s. (control-i is the same as tab which is now used 
  correctly by text pads.)</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling 
  if something goes wrong in generating unique names for picture and sound 
  files.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of 
  text-length text pads (where all the characters have been rubbed out).</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of 
  text pads that end with extra carriage returns.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where if a bird 
  is flying outside and the programmer enters a house the bird waits until the 
  programmer comes back out before proceeding.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another bug where 
  sometimes objects wait for the programmer to return when he or she leaves a 
  house.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Handle better errors that 
  occur in notebooks with pages with objects saved in the old format.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where demo 
  replay sometimes waited many seconds during the titles before starting.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that sometimes 
  occurred when double clicking on an htm.tt file that contains a ToonTalk 
  dialog. E.g. for setting some toontalk.ini options.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way ToonTalk 
  deals with errors if an installation has chosen the option describing users as 
  beginners who shouldn't be bothered by trouble shooting dialogs.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you double click on a TT 
  file that is empty you now get a nice warning in the log file. This was 
  implemented because at least one server (JSPWiki) gives ToonTalk such files 
  when a link to a file is clicked. (In such cases, you need to save the file to 
  the local disk and then open it.)</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">XML files now have the 
  CreatedUsing attribute that indicates which version of ToonTalk created the 
  file.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you double clicked on a 
  TT file while ToonTalk was suspended and the programmer was <i>not</i> sitting 
  on the floor then the object encoded in that file was not loaded.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if 
  time travel was enabled then the check box indicating you wanted media files 
  to be included with cities or the saved object was ignored.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem using the 
  'Edit Picture' feature when the picture was brought into ToonTalk by copying 
  and pasting from a non-local web page.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems where 
  text not on text pads didn't display as well due to the changes to support 
  tabs implemented on 1/9.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Enhanced the dialog that 
  asks your name to include a check mark as to whether <a href="ttravel.htm">
  time travel</a> should be enabled. The default for the check mark is what it 
  was set to in the previous dialog.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added command line support 
  for controlling whether the <a href="ttravel.htm">time travel </a>check mark 
  is set in the &quot;ask your name dialog&quot;. The new command is
  <a href="command.htm#TimeTravelEnabled">-time_travel_enabled command</a>.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">15/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If no city has been saved by 
  a user and time travel had been enabled was then disabled the user begins in 
  the city saved at the end of the last time travel session.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Enabling
  <a href="ttravel.htm">time travel</a> now sets <a href="ttini.htm#SaveInXML">
  SaveInXML</a> to 1 regardless of the setting in toontalk.ini. Time travel 
  can't work without the XML format.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a time travel replay 
  bug.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a time travel 
  recording bug.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The customization
  <a href="options.htm#HowMartySpeaks">remote control for how Marty speaks</a> 
  now works for the options of speaking with subtitles and subtitles only.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the speed of 
  displaying changes to text pads and for saving them in XML. And made minor 
  improvements to how the text looks.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If starting time travel and 
  there is no saved city from the previous session (because this the first 
  session or there was an error or abnormal exit) then if there is an explictily 
  saved city the user starts in it.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The credits are no longer 
  displayed after the splash screen when replaying a demo file.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When things are saved they 
  are saved in XML even if the <a href="ttini.htm#SaveInXML">SaveInXML</a> is 
  set to 0 in toontalk.ini. Control-c to put something on the clipboard is the 
  only way to save things in the old format now.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">18/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving in XML 
  nests that have been copied. They worked correctly only the first time the 
  bird delivers something.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the geometry of 
  non-rectangular objects and numbers on top of nests.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a city saved with 
  notebooks of remote controls for a picture on the floor was restored with 
  empty notebooks.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you flipped 
  over a remote control for the looks of a picture only an empty notebook 
  emerged.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several bugs related 
  to scrolling happening while activities are in progress. For example before 
  Bammer smashes things together. The fix speeds up Bammer so much he finishes 
  instantly when you cause the camera to pan (or when you scroll on the floor).</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A corrupted demo or time 
  travel archive (or various bugs) can cause ToonTalk to run out of memory. 
  ToonTalk now recovers better from such problems.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you double 
  clicked on a file it loaded fine but the log file spuriously reported a 
  problem loading the file.</font></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved replay during
  <a href="ttravel.htm">time travel</a> when robots are involved.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where copies

</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">20/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where you 
  could rubout a decimal number less than 1 until there was just one digit left. 
  Now you can rubout the last digit to obtain 0.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where scales 
  showed the wrong relationship when both numbers were negative and one was an 
  integer and the other a rational number. This fix didn't completely fix the 
  problem but on 2/10 the remaining problem was fixed.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented a new 
  toontalk.ini switch called <a href="ttini.htm#SaveMediaInSubNotebooks">
  SaveMediaInSubNotebooks</a> that ensures that any media in notebooks added to 
  the main notebook are saved so that you can send your entire directory of user

</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a time travel 
  interface bug where you paused ToonTalk to enter the time travel interface and 
  then clicked upon the play button before clicking any other button.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something is placed on 
  the clipboard ToonTalk typically indents the XML to be more readable. Since 
  this is very costly for very large files (those whose un-indented size is is 
  greater than 5,000,000 characters) those are left un-indented.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">23/9</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot takes sometimes 
  from a nest while a bird is delivering something and you walk out of the room 
  sometimes ToonTalk crashed (without a crash report since it was an infinite 
  recursion).</font></span></li>

  his training correctly if something was taken out of a box, place on the 
  floor, put back in a box, and then taken out again and put on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a robot changed the 
  number of holes that a box has by typing a digit, the width of the box stayed 
  the same. Looked particularly bad when changing a box to one with zero holes.
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a box of zero holes is given more holes via 
  the keyboard (by either a robot or the programmer), then the width of the

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Bammer smashed together two things and then 
  either the city is saved or that point in time is returned to via time travel

  original values.</font></li>

  displayed as shrinking digits that when restored the digits don't shrink in a 
  way that is easy to read.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In some very rare cases dividing an integer by

  the past with time travel and recorded new segments that when replayed you saw 
  the old segments. This problem only occurred within the same session.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A keyboard event while replaying time travel 
  now acts as if the Pause button were clicked.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem during time travel replay where 
  sometimes Tooly would jump a little bit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now repairs time travel archives that 
  indicate time going backwards between successive segments. This caused objects 
  to move very slowly. Probably caused by abnormal exit when recording.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug generating Java applets where a box 
  contained an erased non-numerical sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a flipped picture's 
  size was changed then the city is saved (or time travel is enabled) that it is 
  restored with the wrong size.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets that 
  contain negative non-integer values.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug running Java applets that contain 
  operations applied to read-only sensors (e.g. to the random number sensor to 
  obtain the desired range).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a new toontalk.ini option called
  <a href="ttini.htm#DurationBeforeAutoHideTimeTravelButtons">
  DurationBeforeAutoHideTimeTravelButtons</a>. By default during replay the time 
  travel interface hides itself after 3 seconds of no mouse movement.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling when loading a 
  corrupt log or time travel archive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time travel archives can now be enhanced with 
  subtitles, recorded audio (e.g. narration), and machine-generated speech.
  <a href="tt_dmo.htm">Click here</a> for information about making your own time 
  travel demos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying things whose width 
  or height is more than 25 times the screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced over a year ago so that 
  if you set <a href="ttini.htm#UserFiles">UserFiles</a> the files were saved 
  but not read on the next session.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 1/10 that caused 
  ToonTalk to frequently ignore the USR file so Marty and the puzzle game always 
  treated the user as a brand new user.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug triggered by saving everything on 
  the floor (by pressing control-c while your hand is empty) a second time in 
  the same session. Objects involved subsequently didn't save correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that caused Tooly to appear to be 
  empty sometimes during time travel.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where occasionally ToonTalk would 
  hang while loading a city with copied nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you press '.' while holding a box you now 
  turn off all of its contents. Typing space turns them all on. (Requires Beta 
  41 or 3.27X or higher.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug generating Java applets when a 
  robot used a magic wand and then didn't immediately drop the copy in a box or 
  on a bird.</font></li>

  off that when restored or replayed the truck didn't continue driving.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug running Java applets that relied 
  upon comparing very large numbers.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">13/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you save a sensor with a textual value 
  (e.g. yes or no) it is saved in a manner so that when loaded into another 
  language version of ToonTalk it is not translated into that language. There 
  was a bug where it was restored correctly but if then saved again it was 
  converted to the new language.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while holding a flipped picture you press 
  Pause and click on 'Edit Picture' you'll be able to edit the graphics but when 
  you return to ToonTalk an image of the flipped picture does not appear 
  automatically.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">15/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that caused copies of user sounds 
  to not work.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On 20/10 fixed problem where if a robot changed 
  the number of holes of a box the remaining part may end up far from the robot. 
  This caused a bug where if the programmer has a box with many holes and 
  changes it to few holes via the keyboard then part of the box ended up off 
  screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flipped a picture and scrolled at the 
  same time then sometimes the display of the notebook of sensors was wrong.
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you paste a sound file, a text string (not a 
  saved text pad), or a number (not a saved number pad) it now appears in good 
  size (the same size that Pumpy would make it if 'G' was pressed).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug running Java applets that set the 
  width or height of a picture to a negative value.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">20/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced in August where 
  sometimes if you used 'Set Options' to pick a voice for Marty a different 
  voice was used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some minor problems caused by a robot 
  putting his box in a truck and sending it off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets 
  containing copies of the same user picture. Sometimes they became different 
  pictures that looked the same but did not match.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a time travel bug caused by going back to 
  the first segment and typing record. The resulting time travel archive had an 
  improper first segment.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem restoring a city or replaying 
  time travel archives where Marty is speaking with a talk balloon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where when the record button in 
  time travel was pressed that your hand jumped (or if outside your persona or 
  the helicopter moved).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem restoring a city or replaying 
  time travel where sometimes you'd see two empty helicopters.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When double clicking on a time travel archive 
  (a DMO file) the time travel buttons are now hidden after one second.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When double clicking on a time travel archive 
  or a demo file (a DMO file), Marty called you &quot;No Name&quot; regardless of the name 
  used when recording. Also if not running full-screen the title bar used &quot;No 
  Name&quot; as well.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">23/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty uses talk balloons without speech 
  the text in the balloons was often broken in mid sentence.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes Pumpy got mixed 
  up and made sounds and animated as if he was still on when he was turned off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug replaying a time travel archive 
  where sometimes all of Tooly wiggles rather than the item inside that you are 
  pointing to.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes spurious warnings appeared about a

<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading 
  pictures where the size of boxes on the back were too large before being 
  flipped over. (This broke the Adventure Game of the Playground since an object 
  in a box thought it was off screen and blew itself up.)</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where copies 
  of user sounds sometimes displayed nonsense text for the their name.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced 
  problem (in the X versions) that caused non-time travel DMO files to exit 
  immediately when run.</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">26/11</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug when clicking on

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in pasting in an object containing 
  bird/nest pairs twice in the same session.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that could cause a crash or the 
  wrong bird/nest connection if you press F11 to unbam something containing a 
  bird or a nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.31.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/12</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a time travel bug where replay wasn't 
  accurate if you were holding Pumpy (or maybe also Dusty) at the boundary 
  between time travel segments.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug caused by having a roof or house 
  decoration in different houses and pictures added to it. The sensors in the 
  other houses showed the things added to the other houses.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems that on some configurations of Windows 
  98 some of the new HTML-based dialogs cause an error. ToonTalk now recovers 
  from these errors and continues by using the old dialogs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the initial dialogs and 
  the 'Set Options' dialogs did not revert back to the old style if the HTML 
  files are not available.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you used Pumpy on the floor and then dropped 
  him sometimes he kept making a pumping sound.</font></li>

  SecondsBetweenLogs</a> is not set in toontalk.ini then the default value is 
  now 10 seconds and not 15 seconds.</font></li>

  that had been flipped (e.g. to put robots on the back)&nbsp; that is in a box 
  is now improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with subtitles and Marty

  say.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.33.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/12</font></span></p>

<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a minor bug introduced 
  on 1/12 saving birds in XML.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture is turned the 
  robots on the back ran immediately but that meant it was possible for a robot 
  to match and then run after sensors had been updated. Turning on a picture now 
  starts the robots on the next cycle.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem copying user 
  sounds that hadn't loaded correctly.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a TT file containing XML 
  or pasting XML into ToonTalk now works even if there is extra text or XML

  through the credits and you had a saved city where you were on the floor that 
  the newly created object didn't appear until you scrolled or got up.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied a picture with 
  sensors on the back and dropped it directly on another object then the sensors 
  weren't connected up immediately. For example, copying a ball in the Pong game 
  didn't work unless you set the ball on the floor or saved or copied the game 
  after adding a ball.</font></span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.36.</font></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/12</font></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot trained to flip 
  pages of a notebook only worked when on the floor.</font></span></li>

  now have a check box for indicating that you don't want to see this dialog 
  ever again (unless you edit your toontalk.ini file).</span></font></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem replaying 
  demos and time travel archives where Marty speaks in a language different from 
  the displayed language. (This bug occurred even if one was UK English and the 
  other was US English.)</font></span></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sometimes if you travel back 
  in time and train a robot the robot has some extra training &quot;from the future&quot;. 
  Usually the robot gets very mixed up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The dialog asking if you want to see the log 
  file (when something important is in it) now has a check box for indicating to 
  never display it again.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/16</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where saving a rational number 
  whose numerator is negative and has over 100 digits sometimes caused errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug generating Java applets containing 
  robots that use the main notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed the limit of 64K from the size of text 
  pads. The limit is now 10% of the physical memory of your computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the XXver22.dll (where XX is replaced by the 
  language specific version) is missing, then ToonTalk crashed. Now you get a 
  dialog box explaining the file is missing.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/17</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug caused by standing up holding a box 
  containing a nest that is receiving something. (Actually the symptom of the 
  bug was caught and repaired so it didn't manifest itself.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where time travel can crash if the 
  user had earlier stopped doing the puzzle game while using sensors such as the 
  millisecond timer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time travel and demos did not work properly 
  when changes to the main notebook were being made.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 11/22 where the first

  city was saved. Affected demos as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug restoring a city saved while 
  something was in the process of being added to a notebook. Affected time 
  travel as well.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/18</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug generating Java applets where 
  rarely some steps a robot did weren't generated. These involved dropping 
  things on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets when 
  the Hit or Miss sensors were erased in a thought bubble (but some problems 
  remain - best not to do this).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sometimes a sensor's sign was 
  changed and the change wasn't propagated to other sensors or to the picture 
  involved. The sensor needed to have a rational value and then an integer value 
  for this to sometimes occur.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you use the Integer Part operation and the 
  result can fit into 32-bit then a faster and leaner internal representation is 
  now used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when replaying a non-time travel DMO 
  file, you saw the time travel interface after pressing Pause.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the toontalk.ini Switch called 
  RemovePlaygroundActiveDocumentation which if given a non-zero value will when 
  saving a city or an object skip over flipped pictures that contain any of

  change\ntext to\nspeech&quot;, &quot;Speech\nmechanism&quot;, &quot;I speak\nthe text\nwhen you\npoint 
  to\nme and press\nthe spacebar&quot;, &quot;I remove a\nspace, if I you\npoint to me\nand 
  type a space&quot; (where \n indicates a new line). Enabling this can slow down 
  saving cities or objects so don't enable it unless you need to. Works only 
  with the X versions (e.g. 3.38X).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.38.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/23</font></p>

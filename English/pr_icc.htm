<p class="MsoBodyText3">SAN CARLOS, CA. &#150; June 13, 2002&#151;Animated Programs&#146;
ToonTalk 2, the award-winning guide to computer programming, and creator Ken Kahn will be
part of the Art.Bit Collection exhibit and symposium at the InterCommunication Center
(ICC) in Tokyo, Japan, June 21-August 11, 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr.
Kahn has been chosen to display ToonTalk 2 at the exhibit and to participate in a Visual
Programming Environment symposium by Art.Bit Collection guest curator Kouichirou Eto. The
Art.Bit Collection exhibit is designed to introduce innovative software into the art field
and Mr. Eto is a researcher at the International Media Research Foundation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3">The Art.Bit Collection exhibits art works in the field of digital
software, promoting the possibility of software as a medium, tool, material and
environment for the arts. ToonTalk 2 teaches the basics of programming, including
constructing, debugging and running programs, in a joyful interactive world. It makes
programming easy for children of all ages to understand by animating familiar objects such
as birds, robots, trucks and bicycle pumps rather than presenting traditional textual
exercises. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3">There are three ways users learn the basics in ToonTalk 2. They
can solve a series of interactive puzzle games in an engaging and enjoyable environment
that gradually teaches programming construction and techniques. They can also enter the
&#147;free play&#148; zone, an open-ended, rich environment of exploration and discovery,
or view narrated demonstrations, which show how to build and debug programs. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3">&#147;It is a great honor for ToonTalk 2 to be chosen for
exhibition at the Art.Bit Collection and for myself to participate in their symposium on
Visual Programming Environment,&#148; says Ken Kahn, President and Founder of Animated
Programs. He adds, &#147;I am a believer in the ability of software to contribute to the
arts in a very beneficial fashion. This is particularly true of ToonTalk 2 because of its
unique combination of fun and learning.&#148; Dr. Kahn will oversee a special one-day
ToonTalk 2 workshop for kids a week after the symposium.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3">ToonTalk 2 teaches critical thinking skills such as problem
decomposition, component composition, abstraction, puzzle solving, experimentation and
logic. It is fully Internet-enabled and tightly integrated with the browser. Users can
program their creations and then share them with friends and family.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">ToonTalk 2 is currently available for Windows at $24.95 and can be
ordered online at <a href="http://www.toontalk.com/">www.toontalk.com</a> or by calling
800-317-9830. Versions are also available in Japanese, UK English, Swedish, European
Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/1</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If while training a robot the main box 
  (My Box) is split into pieces and the pieces are joined so that the main box 
  ends up on the right or inside another box then sometimes the robot used to 
  vacuum up its box after running.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/2</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a picture has a sensor on 
  its back and the picture has been turned into an infinite stack then ToonTalk 
  crashed when a copy of the picture was removed from the stack.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When you stand up or enter a thought 
  bubble your hand automatically moves down off the screen. If while moving the 
  hand pointed to a picture which was using the Selected sensor then it used to 
  be triggered even if the hand was moving automatically.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/17</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a picture was added to a decoration 
  sensor (for the wall, room, or roof) and then that picture moved or changed 
  size by changing sensors then the decoration on the wall, room, or roof wasn't 
  updated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.183.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/30</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the sensor for whether a picture is 
  selected is on the back of a picture and that picture is copied then the 
  sensor in the copy showed that it is selected until it is deselected, 
  selected, and then deselected again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.184.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/12</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem editing the label on a 
  nest or a robot with arrow keys.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Restored a feature (after about 3 
  years) that when a nest is saved and all its birds have been destroyed then 
  when it is restored there is a new egg in the nest and a new bird will hatch.</font></li>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Scales no longer consider upper 
  and lower case versions of the same letter as equal. Note that scales saved as 
  part of old programs continue to behave as before.</font></big></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/21</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The restoration of the saving of a 
  nest with no birds as a nest with an egg (see 5/9) did not work (immediately) 
  when the nest was saved in a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot is given a box that has an 
  empty hole where something else is in the corresponding position in the box in 
  the robot's thought bubble, then the robot waits for something to be put in 
  that hole. For the last 3 years a portion of the box in the thought bubble 
  glows red. It no longer does since glowing red is understood to mean a 
  mismatch not a suspension of matching.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The ToonTalk executable now supports 
  Spanish if a Spanish version of ToonTalk is available (it is in progress).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><a name="Beta52">Released 3.185 and Beta 51.</a></font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">6/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot was trained to type 
  something to something and when running that thing isn't there, the robot used 
  to hang. Now it continues and a warning is added to the log file.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced on 1/15/05 that 
  caused an error when rubbing out an empty robot name (e.g. typing rubout twice 
  after picking up a robot).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If ran with
  <a href="ttini.htm#DontScrollOnFloor">DontScrollOnFloor</a> = 1 and then reset 
  it to 0 then you still couldn't move around on the floor if logged in with a 
  user name that had been saved with scrolling turned off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes (for example, when turned 
  into a stack) a user imported picture in a saved city became full sized when 
  copied/selected.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you erased a sensor and then 
  vacuumed up the picture being sensed then if other objects are vacuumed so 
  that the picture is destroyed then the internal state became inconsistent and 
  crashes were possible. This can happen if the number of items vacuumed exceeds
  <a href="ttini.htm#MaximumItemsInDusty">MaximumItemsInDusty</a>.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/11</font></p>
<ol>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with the container 
  sensor that it doesn't show something that is on the back of something else.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where undo did nothing 
  when it should have been able to undo the last action of Bammer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.187.</font></li>

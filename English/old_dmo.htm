<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>How to Create Your Own Demos</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF0000"><b>WARNING: MUCH OF
THIS HAS CHANGED SINCE VERSION 2.33 OR BETA 26</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF0000"><b><a
href="make_dmo.htm">CLICK HERE</a> FOR THE NEW VERSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i>Advanced users:</i></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To create a demo just add -o &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt; to <a
href="command.htm#OutputLog">the command line</a> before starting ToonTalk. This will
create a file named filename.DMO in the &quot;demos&quot; subdirectory of ToonTalk. The
&quot;dmo&quot; file records everything you do (every mouse movement, keyboard click,
etc.) Double clicking on the file will start up the demo. Alternatively adding -I
&lt;filename&gt; to the command line will run the demo. Please check the &quot;demos&quot;
subdirectory first to learn the names of existing demos so you don't override them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are creating a demo on a fast computer and expect the
demo to be run on slower machines then it is recommended that you add <a
href="command.htm#FrameDurationMinimum">-y 50</a> or so to the command line while
recording to slow down your machine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding subtitles to your demos</b>. When ToonTalk starts
running a demo named X it looks for a file named X.ust. (&quot;ust&quot; is the default
extension name for (American) English subtitles.) You can override the default for your
computer by providing an &quot;SubtitlesSuffix&quot; entry in the
&quot;FileExtensions&quot; section of the ToonTalk.ini file in your Windows directory. A
subtitle file is made of entries separated by a blank line. Each entry has the time in
milliseconds since the beginning of the demo followed by the text of the subtitle. It is
recommended that any lines of text more than 60 characters be broken. The
&quot;demos&quot; subdirectory of your ToonTalk installation has many sample subtitle
files. One way to obtain the millisecond timings is to press F9 while the demo is playing
back.This will record the time in your &lt;username&gt;.txt log file in the
&quot;users&quot; subdirectory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding narration to your demos</b>. When ToonTalk starts
running a demo named X it looks for a file named X.spk. (&quot;spk&quot; is the default
extension name for (American) English narration files.) You can override the default for
your computer by providing an &quot;SubtitlesSuffix&quot; entry in the
&quot;FileExtensions&quot; section of the ToonTalk.ini file in your Windows directory. To
create a narration file you should record segments of the narration (256 is the maximum
number) and name them &quot;s01.wav&quot;, &quot;s02.wav&quot; and so on. These files
should be placed on the main ToonTalk directory. While replaying your demo you should
press F11 to start the next narration segment. If you prefer to record and synchronize the
pre-recorded narration instead then add -d 451 to the command line as well as the -o
&lt;filename&gt; and again press F11 when you wish to add the next narration segment. When
ToonTalk exits it will write a new &quot;spk&quot; in the demos subdirectory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Coordinating the subtitles and narration</b>. If you wish
to create both narration and subtitles, it is recommended you create the narration first
and then run your demo with &quot;-d 3210&quot; which will print the start times of each
segment in your &lt;<i>username</i>&gt;.log in the &quot;Users&quot; subdirectory. You can
then use these times in your subtitles file. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Tips:</b></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A demo file works for the same resolution as it was recorded.
    With luck you can record a high-resolution demo and copy it to the low resolution
    subdirectory and it will work. See the subdirectories of &quot;Demos&quot;. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A demo recorded with speech on might not replay correctly
    when speech is turned off. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Speech is turned off when replaying a demo with narration
    unless you are <a href="command.htm#TextToSpeechUsesDirectSound">running with the
    text-to-speech engine using DirectSound</a>. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you make a mistake while recording a demo you needn't redo
    the whole thing. You can run tt202 -I PartlyGood -o NewVersion and then take control just
    before the old demo goes bad. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Avoid using keyboard accelerators for tools (e.g. 'e' to make
    Dusty erase things). These accelerators differ from language to language so if you use
    them your demos probably won't work in a different language version of ToonTalk. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you create a demo for a user named Pat, then when that
    demo is run it may change the user profile for Pat. To avoid this use -t 1 in the command
    line to indicate that this is a &quot;temporary&quot; user and a user profile should not
    be kept.</font></li>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk can work with <a href="newnum.htm">numbers of any size</a> (that fits in the
computer). As numbers get very long you might notice ToonTalk freezes for a while when the
number changes, is copied, or when you sit down in a room with large numbers on the floor.
Numbers with less than a thousand digits should not cause this problem. Nor should you see
freezing when robots are working with numbers with a million digits if they are in another
house or on the back of picture. However the first time you look at a number that is a
million digits long you may have to wait many hours as ToonTalk converts the number for
viewing.</font></big></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you really want to work with numbers
that have thousands or millions of digits, then you can avoid these long pauses by seeing
the numbers in base 2 (binary), base 4, base 8 (octal), base 16 (hexadecimal) or base 32. <a

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">These problems can also occur when dealing
with exact fractions since they are internally represented as two potentially large
numbers: one for the numerator and the other for the denominator.</font></big></p>

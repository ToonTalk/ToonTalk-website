<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/4/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture was given a speed while it was in a box then it
    appeared to move out of the box until you tried to pick the box up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture was dropped on the remote control for the looks
    of another picture, then the robots on the back of the dropped picture didn't run. And the
    appropriate sensors didn't notice that the picture was dropped.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/5/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture vacuums up his box, then
    he now is removed from the back of the picture. This is a good way of expressing the
    termination of one behavior on the back of a picture since using a bomb will destroy the
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/10/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to flip a picture over, get out some
    remote controls, flip the picture back over, and add it to some other picture, then when
    he ran the picture was added so that its center is the where the lower left corner should
    be. This bug fixed itself when you pointed to the picture but now won't happen to start
    with.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/23/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to take out the notebook of sensors
    and then drop it back in the main notebook, then sometimes when that robot was running in
    another house it caused a crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Under rare conditions ToonTalk crashed when a sensor was used
    in a house where the user wasn't.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/27/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On some systems dropping a box on a blank number pad caused
    errors. Thanks to Kevin O'Brien for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you can hear Bammer's hammer make a sound even when
    he was in another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you train a robot to place something on the roof, house,
    or wall decoration the placement and size was not a good default.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots can no longer be named 'fuc' in the American and UK
    version (once a new version of ustt??.dll and uktt??.dll are installed).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you train a robot to drop a picture on a picture, the
    robot now drops the picture by default so that it is centered on the underlying picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/28/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nearly 10 warnings or error messages reported by Marty used
    to say &quot;A robot X&quot;, now he says &quot;A robot named Y X&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors in thought bubbles animated when the robot was placed
    on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when thought bubbles have collision detectors in
    them, the robots were not saved quite right. Sometimes all worked fine and sometimes
    strange things happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to pick up the box he was given and
    set it down and then use it, he got confused when running on the back of a picture. Thanks
    to Ross Adamson for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now erase a picture or a remote looks more than one
    time. (Still are other known bugs with remote looks still.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/29/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many changes to remote looks so that it and the picture it
    &quot;controls&quot; are kept in sync better. Especially if the remote is repeatedly
    erased and given a new appearance. Also changes in size of one is reflected in the other
    now.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When using Pumpy to make a picture a good size ('G'), the
    size no longer depends upon the history of the size changes to the picture but is a good
    size for that picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to flip pages in a notebook he was
    holding and used shift-click (or right mouse button if enabled) then the robot didn't
    remember the page flips. Thanks to Ross Adamson for pointing this problem out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many more changes to remote looks so that it and the picture
    it &quot;controls&quot; are kept in sync better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots shouldn't work on the front of pictures but by
    pressing 'f' twice very fast they sometimes do. If you save such a picture the robots go
    back to the backside where they belong. Thanks to Lennart Mogren for pointing this out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a city or notebook file has been corrupted (or saved by a
    buggy version of ToonTalk) then sometimes ToonTalk would crash when restarting or page
    flipping. Now the crash is often avoided but the object or city is probably not what it
    should be. Thanks to Miki Grahame for help here.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Still more changes to remote looks so that it and the picture
    it &quot;controls&quot; are kept in sync better.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots were confused when trained to drop a picture on an
    erased picture (to give it a new appearance).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">15/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced a bug where Marty would give a
    spurious warning when flipping over number or text pads.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">16/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where the system would crash
    when shutting down. Caused by erasing pictures and giving them a new appearance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk would crash when saving a box with a picture inside
    with robots working on the back of the picture. Thanks to Kristian Johansson and Stefan
    Sennerö for sending an example of this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">17/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A picture of a number in a box would get a zero width if in a
    box that was vacuumed and then spit out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saving a picture while robots were working on the back would
    sometimes fail.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot trained to pick up and drop the box he was given when
    running on the back of a picture would cause the box to disappear.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture had a small or narrow picture on top when
    saved it might have become even smaller or narrower (so much so that it couldn't be seen).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot on the back of a picture used a vacuum
    the system crashed. Thanks to Miki Grahame for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures remember their size when dropped in a box so that
    when you take them out they animate to their previous size. This was broken if you saved a
    city or box with a picture in it.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">18/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved a picture while flipped with robots and boxes on
    the back they became separated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved a picture while flipped then when you took it
    out again and flipped it, its original size was forgotten.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a flipped picture (with robots and boxes that
    contain sensors) on the back of another picture the behavior is transferred correctly.
    When you then removed the flipped picture, it was not restored but continued to control
    the other picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">19/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a flipped picture on a flipped picture and the
    picture you dropped had other pictures on top of it (on the front) then when you saved it,
    the sizes were wrong (often so wrong that the pictures appeared to have disappeared
    because they were so short).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with flipping pictures with robots and boxes
    on the back and putting them on the flipside of other pictures. Thanks to Ross Adamson for
    sending an example of this bug.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If robot repeatedly types on a text pad the pad got slightly
    shorter. Thanks to Ross Adamson for sending an example of this bug.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you trained a robot to add things to a remote control for
    the decoration of the roof, house, or room then the changes the robot made while being
    trained actually changed the ToonTalk world. Robots during training are just imagining
    things - this shouldn't change the world and no longer does.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the decorations on the wall of the room became
    resized incorrectly. No longer.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">23/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you had a nest on the back of a picture and copied the
    picture then the bird found the nest OK but if you then made a copy of the copy the bird
    did not deliver anything to the copy. Thanks to Miki Grahame for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied a box with a bird and more than 1 copy of her
    nest then it was not copied correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird and a picture with her nest were both in a box and
    something is given to the bird then she delivered it instantly (without flying).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If used the &quot;colliding with&quot; sensor and you collide
    with a picture of a number or text pad, ToonTalk would sometimes crash. Thanks to Kristian
    Johansson and Stefan Sennerö for sending an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem with robots using the
    magic wand on the back of pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">25/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would often say a notebook was longer that it is really
    is since he would count some blank pages at the end.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/3/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some actions and animations happened in zero time when the
    power was off (F8).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/3/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several round off errors including one that caused some
    remote controls of a picture that is part of another picture to not accept a change of the
    width to 0 but changed it back to 1 (or even 2 sometimes).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now pick up a robot and type a new name for him.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way the name of a robot is displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can pick up a bird and type text for her t-shirt.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can pick up a nest and type a label for the nest. If you
    add the label to a nest with an egg in it then the bird will have the same label when she
    hatches.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now give any object to a bird to put on her t-shirt.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Disabled the keyboard shortcuts for dropping things ('D' or
    'd') since interferes with giving labels. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Comments can be added to any object. F8 (power off) now stops
    Marty from flying around (he still will give help). You can now give him 2 things and
    he'll associate the first with the second. If the second item is a text pad, he'll use
    that text when describing the first item. Otherwise he'll describe the second item when
    describing the first. You can get a copy of a comment by giving Marty a commented object.
    This is particularly useful if the second object is a sound recording you wish to play.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new internal file format (version 9). Old
    versions can still be loaded and will be saved in the new version. This means that
    anything saved in version 1.1 (or Beta 15) or later cannot be loaded into an earlier
    version of ToonTalk. The new file format features:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Correct saving of nests that have been copied.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Comments are saved.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User provided names for robots are saved.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Labels for nests (and birds too but that is via the older
        t-shirt scheme) are saved.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures are saved in a more concise manner.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The number of extensions (birds that fly off to DLLs) was
        increased from 255 to 64K.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The number of nests that can be saved at once increased from
        255 to the limit of your machine's memory.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The color and visibility (see all, see some, see none) of
        text pads is now saved.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/4/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you would get a warning in your log file that there
    wasn't enough memory for the next sound and yet there was. This would often cause sounds
    not be heard thereafter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a robot was trained to take box containing
    a picture of non-picture and then that picture was erased then the robot would only accept
    pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where sometimes a bird would
    fly off when going between 2 places on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a performance bug when there are lots of things on the
    floor that are off screen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/5/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User pictures (created by the &quot;File to Picture&quot;
    sensor) saved the full path name for the BMP file. This interfered with sharing things
    with other machines that may have installed ToonTalk on a different directory or drive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes user pictures had a black line on the top or on the
    right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/8/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now give your notebooks titles. These show up on the
    bottom of the notebook. This required yet another file format change to save the titles.
    &nbsp; Just start typing when holding the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The notebook of remote controls of a picture now shows the
    picture on the bottom of the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a scale had a nest to its right then the scale would
    totter causing a robot to give up on matching when he should have (and now does) waited
    for something to appear on the nest. Thanks to Richard Noss and Celia Hoyles for providing
    an example of this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot will now accept a box with a tottering scale if he
    has a tottering scale at the same place in the box in his thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Scales now compare pictures as well as text and number. User
    pictures are compared by the alphabetic order of the file names. User pictures are
    &quot;heavier&quot; than built in pictures. Built in pictures are compared by an internal
    index comparison.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now drop a picture on a nest to cover it up.
    (Previously you needed to give it to the nest's bird to accomplish this.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/9/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in using scales to compare user pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you picked up a wand and kept typing numbers strange
    numbers appeared once the wand counter exceeded 2**31 (about 2 billion). Now the wand
    counter disappears (since it is &quot;infinite&quot;). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now rubout a wand counter to get rid of it. Thanks to
    Miki Grahame for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a truck built a house but wasn't being watched
    (e.g. you just walked into another house), the house was built at a crazy location -
    sometimes off the ToonTalk island. This could lead to other problems later.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/10/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the geometry of pictures that are parts
    of other pictures when saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the location of pictures that are parts
    of other pictures when the picture is flipped and saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where pictures on pictures were confused
    where they were (so for example sounds were not heard).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Did a much better fix of the problem with user pictures that
    sometimes black lines appeared at the top or the sides.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User pictures can now be scaled more the 256 times and
    reduced to less than 1/256 of the original size.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/12/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a nest was on the back of a picture and that picture was
    put in a notebook then every time a copy of the picture was obtained from the notebook
    then copies of the nest were made in such a way that a bird thought all the copies were
    her nest (and she copied herself and what she was given and flew to all the nests). This
    no longer happens if the original of the copy is part of a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">An empty nest now only matches empty nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If no members of a team of robots matched a box given to
    them, but some sensors were involved then it used to be that the final robot would wait
    for a change. Now it is the first robot in the team to try to match against a sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Matching against an empty nest also follows the new rule
    above. I.e. it is treated the same as matching against a sensor since in both cases the
    values can change independent of the team of robots working on that box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot tried to match a value against a nest, it waited
    until something arrived on the nest. Now an earlier member of the team of robots will wait
    if he is the first to fail to match due to sensors or nest matching.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty would sometimes say there were some number of objects
    on the flipside of a picture when there was really one less than the number he gave.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/16/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a box on the back of a picture was lost
    when a robot picked it up and dropped it. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/24/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed 2 bugs that caused boxes to sometimes disappear from
    the back of pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk crashed if a bird is returning to a
    picture with a nest on the back that has been dropped onto a notebook.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/25/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed several bugs where boxes or robots that were on the
    back of a picture that was on the back of another picture moved to the back of the
    containing picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where you would see a bird flying when both
    the bird and nest were on the back of the same picture (but at different levels).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug saving a city while birds were flying around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk crashed if Marty needed more than
    20,000 characters to describe something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty tried to describe a flipped
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/26/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot on the back of a picture set down a nest with an
    egg in it then the bird ended up on the floor instead of on the back of the picture where
    the robot can use it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots on the back of pictures now do much less work. Since
    they accomplish as much and aren't being watched no one knows.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/27/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where things that change when dropped (e.g. a
    nest with an egg) didn't work properly on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes robot's lost the name a user
    game then and reverted to their generated name.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/28/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when saving a city with a notebook open to
    the remote looks of something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the geometry of the remote looks of a flipped
    picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/39/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where if a puzzle included a notebook, then it
    crashed if the notebook is dropped. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting this one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the floor was saved via F6 and a copy of Tooly was on the
    floor, then Tooly did not appear when the puzzle was run.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the order of pictures was not displayed correctly.
    One symptom was that sometimes in puzzles you could see ### on top rather than below some
    picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the goal of a picture isn't rectangular you could see ###
    underneath. No longer. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/30/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a player does a sequence of user puzzles (not the built-in
    ones) then the log file wasn't replayable. To replay a log that ran on user puzzles
    currently can only be done by adding &quot;-puzzle &lt;file name&gt; -I &lt;log file
    name&gt;&quot; to the ToonTalk icon or running it from a shell. Thanks to Lennart for
    sending an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture contained a picture than contained a picture
    then ToonTalk crashed when you tried to flip it over. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for
    reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you give a bird a picture that isn't rectangular (or a
    scale) then the nest underneath disappeared. Now you can see the entire stack. The issue
    of whether Marty should still talk about pictures being rectangular when their visibility
    is set to &quot;See some&quot; is still an open question. Thanks to Miki for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty got mixed up talking about a box containing a notebook
    (other than one that started off being the blank notebook). When such a box was placed in
    a robot's thought bubble, then ToonTalk crashed when Marty described the robot. Thanks to
    Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;picture #&quot; sensor behaved strangely for user
    pictures (created by &quot;File to Picture&quot;). Thanks to Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to pick something from a stack and
    then returns it to the stack, then he didn't run well on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you take things off a nest and set them down after a few
    of them that work fine, you used to find that you couldn't pick back up the things you set
    down. Thanks to Miki for reporting this.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/31/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now add -houses &lt;n&gt; to the command line to
    control how many houses are on a block. The number can be between 1 and at least 255.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a sensor that has a clear numeric value on a
    number then it is added as if it were that number. Addresses work this way now. Also
    sensors whose value is &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; have the value 1 and 0
    respectively.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a robot in another house drops something on
    an erased box. Thanks to P.A. Dreyfuss for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/1/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you save a city (or a floor in making a puzzle)
    with pictures that are active (i.e. robots are running on the back) then they now run when
    restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you drop a picture with robots on the back with
    the power off then the picture runs when the power is restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now use control-c to copy what is in your
    hand to the Windows clipboard and control-v to paste what is on the clipboard onto the
    floor. Robots can be trained to do this as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When you save a city it now saves the &quot;number
    of houses to a block&quot; parameter as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed various bugs that can cause user created
    puzzles to crash (these were due to the fact that some code expected Tooly the Toolbox to
    be around and he often isn't in puzzles). Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed some geometry problems with large numbers of
    houses to a block</font><font SIZE="2" face="Comic Sans MS">.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/2/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Extended the format of puzzle files to include user
    defined robots that can accept or reject answers. See <a

    for details.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/5/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug with comments on remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added <a href="ttini.htm#GeneralTextToSpeechEngine">a
    new element to toontalk.ini</a>. Within the </font><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Switches&quot;
    area you can now have &quot;GeneralTextToSpeechEngine=1&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/7/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where nests didn't display their labels.
    (Introduced on 3/31/99.) Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added two new sensors to the notebook of sensors for
    a picture -- <a href="remote.htm#Parts">Parts</a> and <a href="remote.htm#Containers">Containers</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you vacuumed up the remote control for the looks
    of a picture that was on the floor then that picture became very narrow.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if you grabbed a working robot, you got a
    spurious warning from Marty about the robot being confused.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/8/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling when a robot tries to
    use a hole in a box and the box he has doesn't have such a hole.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a picture had many items on top and one of those
    items was on top of another then you were forced to select lower one when using Dusty,
    Pumpy, or Maggie.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when you had a picture of some text, the
    text color was not saved correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Now if you drop a remote control for the looks for
    something on a blank picture, then the blank picture gets the appearance of the remote
    control but becomes an ordinary picture and doesn't act like a remote control.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Remote looks now (like all the other remote
    controls) becomes attached to a picture if it is dropped on the backside of the picture.
    This enables flipped pictures using remote looks to be added to other flipped pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty no longer says &quot;which is partly visible
    which is partly visible&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a few places so that the some internal errors
    are avoided before they cause problems.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/9/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed the display of stacks of pictures on a nest
    when more than 1 non-rectangular picture is on top. (Or the pictures really rectangular
    but their visibility is set to &quot;SEE SOME&quot; a better way of talking about this.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with the display of a label of a
    nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you type &quot;rubout&quot; when holding a robot
    when an automatically generated name, you now erase the last letter of the name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now rubout all the letters of a robot's name
    if you want a blank or empty name. Note you probably shouldn't do this to robots you plan
    to convert to Java and put on a web page.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/12/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem when a robot on the back of a
    picture tried to set off a bomb. Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot sets off a bomb on the back of a picture
    that has been added to the back of another picture then the containing picture is
    destroyed (along with its parts).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you saved a city with an non-default number of
    houses to a block, then the width of the blocks was wrong when the city was reloaded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if you took a box off a robot on the back
    of a picture and then gave it back to the robot, he would start running while the picture
    was flipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot on the back changed the value of a
    number, then the new value wasn't displayed until you removed the number from the back of
    the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Drop feedback on the back of pictures was improved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now add unflipped pictures to the back of
    pictures. They are treated as comments the same as text pads are here.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes the size of a picture was set to the size
    of the remote control for controlling it even if the remote control was on the flip side
    of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If objects were added or removed from the back of a
    picture when it wasn't flipped, then the geometry of the objects was wrong until an object
    was added or removed by hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty and ToonTalk clipboard pastings sometimes
    described a remote looks with the phrase &quot;remote looksa ...&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">F9 now works everywhere to hide yourself whether you
    are flying, walking, or sitting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When you drop a team of robots they now group
    themselves so they look like they did when the team was put together. Previously they were
    sometimes far apart.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot running on the back of a picture puts his
    box in a truck, then he disappears along with his box. A good way of removing behaviors
    from the back of pictures is to get rid of the robot's box like this or by using Dusty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the &quot;acting&quot; of robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now train a robot to load up a truck even if
    the power is off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug with the explicit placement of houses
    (using addresses) when the block that the truck started at was full. Thanks to Ross for
    reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/13/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you added a label to a notebook, then it was
    difficult to use that notebook until you restarted since rubout, space, and the like were
    often interpreted as changes to the label rather than page flipping.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Some pictures were kept at a fixed width and height
    even though they display an animation sequence that changes size. (Introduced in the last
    few weeks.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot dropped a picture on a picture the
    geometry was often very odd. In particular when the picture underneath has been erased.
    Thanks to Ross for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed problems with the size and location of
    pictures when controlled by robots on the back.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The remote control which shows if a picture is
    dropped is no longer triggered if the picture is inside of something else that is dropped.
    Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with reading the new optional robot
    condition part of puzzles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If some text that appears in Marty's talk balloon
    contained a line feed or carriage return then a box was displayed at that point in the
    text.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">A robot became confused if it was trained to drop a
    number on a blank text pad. Thanks to </font><font face="Comic Sans MS">P.A. Dreyfuss for
    reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/15/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of images that replace another
    image (by erasing the remote control for the looks of a picture and dropping another
    picture on top). Thanks to Ross for providing a nice example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">There were many things that robots should be able to do in
    puzzle mode but weren't allowed to because they don't make sense for the player to do.
    Fixing these is particularly important for using the new robot condition in puzzles.
    Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved the floor of a room to the clipboard via F6
    (useful for making puzzles) then sometimes the connection between birds and nests was
    lost. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors whose value is language dependent, e.g.
    &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; were saved properly in the clipboard but were converted
    to the current default language when the city was saved or such sensors were placed in a
    notebook. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/16/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with a bird whose nest has been copied.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs the occur when constructing a box larger than the
    maximum size. (Default maximum size is 2,048 but can be changed in toontalk.ini by
    changing Switches MaximumNumberOfHoles.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The box that the robot is working inside his thought bubble
    is now visually distinguished from the others. Thanks to Clark Quinn and Miki for
    suggesting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensor for the current keystroke used to go blank when
    there was no keystroke. It now goes black and will not match a blank text pad. Thanks to
    Miki for pointing this out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The space devoted to displaying the label of a notebook was
    shrunk so that for notebooks with 3 digits for page numbers (e.g. the Pictures notebook)
    no longer overlap with the page numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes copying a picture that has flipped pictures on its
    backside resulted in remotes that were connected to the wrong picture. Thanks to Ross for
    providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The collision sensors are no longer updated while the picture
    is flipped over.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/19/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes ToonTalk crashed when a bird was given something
    and her nest had been copied. Thanks to Miki for sending an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird was given a remote control (e.g. the street remote)
    then that remote was not updated until you went into the house. Thanks to Miki for sending
    an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird's nest has been destroyed and she was given
    something then fly away and was destroyed. Now she flies away, destroys what she was
    given, and returns.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug in saving remote controls for
    the address in the notebook or a city.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Scales now compare streets and avenues based upon their
    numeric value - not the alphabetical order of their textual form. Thanks to Miki for
    suggesting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/20/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If robots changed the size or location of a picture while the
    programmer was standing up the size was much too large and location was wrong. Thanks to
    Lennart for sending an example of this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/21/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;Hit Who?&quot; sensor used to display a copy of the
    picture that is being collided with. It is now a remote control for the looks of that
    picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now flip over the remote control for the looks of
    something (and the &quot;Hit Who?&quot; contents of the boxes in the &quot;Parts&quot; and
    &quot;Containers&quot;). The notebook that flies out is full of sensors and controls for
    the &quot;original&quot; of the remote looks. You can also add and remove things from the
    back of a picture by adding or removing them from the flip side of the remote control for
    the looks of that picture. This is very handy for robots.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robots are running on the back of a picture
    and were removed they reappeared.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you removed things from the back of a picture
    the layout was poor until the picture for flipped over again or more things added.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/22/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Marty encountered a dash or hyphen in a sentence, he
    would pronounce it as &quot;minus&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed recently introduced bugs in saving addresses and some
    other remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a robot is given a box with sensors in them, the sensors
    do different things when they end up in the robot's thought bubble. E.g. they become
    blank. The sensors whose values are pictures now behave better when they end up in a
    thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now treat the remote controls for the street and
    avenue like numbers. Scales now compare them like numbers not like text strings. Thanks to
    Richard for his suggestions here.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Creating a Java applet with a hit or miss collision sensor
    sometimes crashed ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the remote control for the looks of something
    became a different size without apparent logic.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem recording and replaying logs where F9 (hide
    your hand - now hide yourself) was used. Thanks to Stefan and Kristian for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/23/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a robot took something out of a notebook it often was
    very narrow and tall. It now uses better sizes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where ToonTalk crashed if a
    robot was looking for a hole that didn't exist.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem training a robot to drop a remote control on
    a blank number pad. Thanks to Ross for sending an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where scales didn't compare pictures right if one
    of the pictures was a remote control (e.g. the &quot;Hit Who?&quot; sensor). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;Hit Who?&quot; sensor was not reset properly if it
    was on the back of a picture that was added to another picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/24/99 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug drawing erased pictures (not clear if there were
    any symptoms). </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/26/99 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots who were trained to use Dusty on a picture in a box
    got confused. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with robots who used Dusty on a remote
    control that shows a picture. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a city was saved with decoration remote controls, the
    remote controls didn't show the current decoration right and couldn't be used properly. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A house or roof decoration remote control caused things near
    its right side to intermittently be invisible. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to remove something from a picture
    then it removed the bottom most item of the right type first. Now it removes the topmost. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/27/99 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Things were vacuumed up when the bomb was used within
    puzzles. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">House decoration sensors had the wrong geometry if you were
    never outside. Going out and coming back in fixed it. Fixed in general now. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Puzzles that enabled function keys didn't work right when the
    function keys were pressed. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the name of a robot drifted off his chest. It
    happens much less now. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you retrained a robot then it now gets a new name. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot became confused if he was originally trained to make
    a sound or a force effect and then was retrained. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/28/99 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some old puzzles were broken because Tooly showed up. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problem introduced this month where some problems with
    puzzles where 2 items became one or a single item got extra blank lines. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The puzzle where Marty says how many days old you are, lacked
    a comma in the US version (if your age is greater than 999 days) and it was spoken as a
    series of digits. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/29/99 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes things on top of a nest disappeared and then
    reappeared. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a nest in a box was covered the nest and
    object covering it were too small. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you saved a city with some kinds of remote controls on the
    floor, then when you started the city again the remote controls were much too large. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the tool that a robot in a team was using would
    become invisible. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added 2 new options to toontalk.ini. StringLibraryDll32 and
    StringLibraryDll16 under the [Executables] section can optionally specify the string
    library to use. This is particularly useful if you wish to have old versions of ToonTalk
    that expect XXTT32.dll or XXTT16.dll where XX is the country code (e.g. US, UK, or SE) and
    new versions that support this option. </font></li>

    a non-collision in a thought bubble even though it in all other ways behaved as if it
    showed a collision.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where copying pictures with things on
    the back sometimes caused the picture to change size and the copy to also have this
    incorrect size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where sometimes the size of pictures
    saved inside a box or notebook was not remembered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes picking up a running game and standing up
    and then sitting down again crashed ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">F4 now calls for the main notebook that lives inside
    of Tooly. (Previously it called for the most recently used notebook.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Just after leaving a robot's thought bubble, his
    name was displayed far to the side of the robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes a picture with robots on the back didn't
    behave correctly if power was off (i.e. F8 had been pressed).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Saving a box to the clipboard that contained a
    comment that was more than 72 characters long and didn't contain spaces sometimes caused
    ToonTalk to freeze.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/15/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now save a city to the clipboard. Currently
    the only interface to this is to sit on the ground outside and press control-c without
    holding anything in your hand. If a city is on the clipboard when ToonTalk is started
    you'll start off in the clipboard city.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty (and the clipboard) sometimes incorrectly
    described boxes with pictures inside.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty (and the clipboard) sometimes incorrectly
    described notebooks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">F6 no longer copies the items on the floor.
    Control-c with an empty hand while sitting on the floor does this now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you named a robot and then trained him, he lost
    his name. It is still the case that a robot is renamed if retrained. This is because it is
    common to copy a robot and retrain a copy to make a variant. The two copies should not
    have the same name after one has been retrained. (Perhaps a future enhancement is only
    rename if indeed the robot has been copied.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you double clicked on a city file and then later
    pressed &quot;Save Everything&quot; the city was saved fine but the message gave the
    entire full path name for the city file when reporting that it had been saved.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/17/99</font> 

<ol>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/18/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If ToonTalk was started by double clicking on a CTY,
    DMO, PZL, or USR file or was given a file name on the command line and the file name had
    more than one &quot;.&quot; in it, ToonTalk became confused.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">User defined sounds (via the remote control

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/30/99</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when ToonTalk is interrupted it displays a

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Changed the way labels were displayed to look nicer.</font></li>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">6/4/66</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk now supports Unicode so it can display all
    the alphabets of the world at once. If the &quot;-language&quot; is Japanese this is
    enabled or if </font><font face="Comic Sans MS">-unicode_code_page &lt;number&gt; is on
    the command line. For example, -unicode_code_page 932 enables the Japanese code page so
    that you can cut and paste Japanese text.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Unless you sat down exactly where you left something
    on the lawn you couldn't move over to it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you placed something on top of another thing
    where its bottom is above the bottom of the thing underneath and then stood up and sat

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The geometry of objects was off slightly when
    sitting on the ground.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a bird was flying to a nest of the back of the

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes a notebook displayed the contents of its
    pages too small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where the remote looks of a user
    picture (created via the &quot;File to Picture&quot; sensor) was zero sized (looked
    invisible). Thanks to Ross and Miki for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you call for a tool while holding it, it was
    dropped and then ran back into your hand. Now it goes back to its &quot;favorite&quot;
    spot. Thanks to Ross and Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you called for your notebook and then flipped to

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If multiple birds without nests are on the back of a

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty describes erased robots better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you copied a robot with the magic wand set to O

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a box was being saved before a bird who was

    have a number then the cities are named by suffixing 1, 2, and so on up to CityFileMax to
    your name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty now describes the '+' and '-' keys better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty no longer sticks a letter or two at the end of
    some utterances. (A bug introduces a couple months ago.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the geometry of what is on the wall in the
    puzzle game - especially when running in low resolution.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If nests are bammed together the nest on top is
    destroyed. The previous version left 2 nests that were identical copies.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you dropped a nest on a notebook and then gave
    the nest's bird a message within a few seconds, ToonTalk got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Birds with copies of its nest inside of Dusty got a
    bit confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">'.' now stops sounds, force effects, sensors, Dusty,
    Pumpy, and pictures. Pictures now can be turned on by pressing the space bar. Note that
    this means you must use '+' and not space to cycle through different images or colors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem saving the remote looks of a user
    picture. Thanks to Miki and Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The keyboard equivalents such as 'f' to flip, or 'h'
    to call for the helicopter are now customized for different language versions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The default binding for the third joystick button is
    now '.'. (As before all joystick button bindings can be user specified.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The GenerateLogs option in toontalk.ini now names
    the generated log files so that log1.dmo is the newest, log2.dmo the second newest, etc.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demo files have been changed so that they now save
    the keyboard equivalents, the initial city, the initial user profile, and the clipboard
    interactions. They will soon also deal with user puzzle files. Note that these new demos
    will not work in older versions of ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demo files now replay correctly if the recording
    started by running a particular puzzle number or a user puzzle by using -puzzle on the
    command line.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes notebooks created in one language version
    of ToonTalk were saved as if they were American English. This affected some of the
    sensors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed (again) a problem where sometimes the
    &quot;Colliding?&quot; sensors initially displayed Tooly the Toolbox rather than a hit or
    miss.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released Beta 17.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta17"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/30</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed several bugs related to creating something on
    a computer with a joystick and then bringing it into a computer without a joystick

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you pasted a box with many holes into ToonTalk
    and the box was too wide for the room, it was displayed incorrectly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The color of text that names sounds was sometimes
    black and sometimes brown. Thanks to Ross and Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you dropped a text pad which contains only digits
    on a blank number pad, the number corresponding to the first half of the digits was
    generated. Was broken for a couple of months. Thanks to Ross and Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if the remote control for the looks of a
    picture was taken by a bird to her nest, that the picture jumped to cover the nest as
    well. Thanks to Ross and Miki for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty would sometimes describe a stack of things
    wrongly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a picture was removed from a picture while the

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when vacuuming up the remote control for
    the looks of a picture, the picture became erased.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty sometimes mistakenly reported that a robot on
    the back of a picture tried to remove something from the floor and it wasn't there.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty sometimes mistakenly reported that a robot on
    the back of a picture couldn't find something that was no longer in the room and then the
    robot would stop working. Thanks to Miki and Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes the remote control for the looks of a
    flipped picture would display with the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If some text is too small to display and its

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes Marty would give a spurious warning about
    something already being on the floor.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug (introduced in June) that caused ASCII

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if you stood up while a robot was working,
    the robot would wait for you to sit again before continuing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a robot picked something up, and then
    you stood up, and then the robot dropped the thing then the size of the dropped thing
    would be much too large. And if you sat down while the robot was holding something it
    would be too small.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added -spoken_language option to the command line.
    The value of this option can be different from the value of -language (or the installed
    language). This way you can have Marty speak, say, in Swedish but see the text in his talk
    balloons in Portuguese. Or whatever.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Occasionally standing up and then sitting down
    changed the size of things dramatically.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The text-to-speech engine is now told to process
    tags. Tags are part of the Microsoft Speech API and are given between 2 \s. E.g</font><font
    face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="4">. </font><font size="3">\Spd=360\
    \Vce=Gender=&quot;Female&quot;\ which says the voice should change to a speed of 360 and a
    female voice. Tags are ignored by some speech engines.</font></font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you stood up or moved to a different part of the
    floor while something was dropping into a truck it sometimes ended up with the wrong size

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk would sometimes crash if Marty was talking

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Changed the way ToonTalk deals with spaces and
    punctuation in generating text for Marty to say. Needed for Japanese and Portuguese
    versions.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced on 7/17 that caused ToonTalk

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where the display of multi-lined text
    pads when part of the pad was clipped on the left was wrong (shifted one character too
    little).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty would describe a blank remote control as a
    number even when it was a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty had problems describing some kinds of remote
    controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Changed ToonTalk so that if you are training a robot
    and stop while the robot is holding Dusty then ToonTalk no longer makes that robot clean
    up all the things he leaves on the floor. This means you can now train robots to put
    things in a new houses.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk sometimes crashes
    (only observed on Windows NT) as it was trying to put a dialog box asking if you want to
    see your log file. This only happens if the log file contains important warnings or
    errors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If ToonTalk is trying to reconstruct a user picture
    and something is wrong with the BMP file, the problem no longer breaks the loading of
    other things.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk can now read files specified by URLs. The
    sensors &quot;File to Picture&quot; and &quot;File to Sound&quot; now accept text pads
    like <a href="http://www.toontalk.com/ghost.bmp">&quot;http://www.toontalk.com/ghost.bmp&quot;</a>.
    Other places where file names can be given to ToonTalk (e.g. new puzzle sequences or a
    user created city or demo) also accept URLs now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a sensor like &quot;File to Picture&quot; or
    &quot;File to Sound&quot; had a picture or sound on top (not yet vacuumed off by Dusty)
    and you saved the city, then the city would not load properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty would describe a picture created by &quot;File
    to Picture&quot; in a redundant fashion.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug in the display of Unicode text in talk
    balloons. Only used now by Japanese version.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If Windows reports an error to ToonTalk when reading
    a URL, ToonTalk now reports the error to the user and offers the choice of continuing
    off-line.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When ToonTalk has completed replaying a demo (a DMO
    file), it now sees if there is a following DMO file and if so loads it and continues. E.g.
    demo2.dmo will be run after demo1.dmo completes.</font></li>
  <li><a name="Beta18"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Beta 18 released.</font></a></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Recent versions of ToonTalk were not able to run old
    demo files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a few rare problems that occur when standing

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that occasionally caused ToonTalk to
    crash while exiting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Tooly the Toolbox now responds to F6. F6 twice will
    cause him to come very quickly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When the main notebook left Tooly it briefly
    displayed its label very large.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Finished extending ToonTalk to run in resolutions
    ranging from 800x600 to 1600x1200.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">By default ToonTalk now uses smaller objects
    (actually the same number of pixels but less screen area) if you are running in a
    resolution greater than 640x480.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem calling for the notebook where
    sometimes it didn't settle down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug saving cities (or floors) where a text
    pad or number pad was flipped over and on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you resize or move around your tools while
    training a robot, those changes do not change the tools' &quot;favorite&quot; locations or
    sizes.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the animation of the notebook flying to
    your hand (when called by F4).</font></li>

    you press PageDown while Marty is speaking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you start the puzzle game from the beginning and
    don't get very far then ToonTalk offers to show you a web page explaining how to get hints
    from Marty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk can now use higher resolution background
    images if running with more than 640x480 screen size.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a city is saved while Marty is around, then he'll
    be around when you restore the city.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a city was saved while on the floor, then when
    restored you saw Tooly run in and settle down. He is now where he was when you saved.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The options reached by clicking on 'Set Options'
    when starting ToonTalk now gives you options for more kinds of screen sizes. And it no
    longer offers to run the 16-bit version of ToonTalk. (The 16-bit version is no longer
    being updated.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The options now gives you a choice of what
    text-to-speech voice you want Marty to use. This only applies if more than 1 voice has
    been installed. (Microsoft has some free voices at
  <a href="http://microsoft.com/msagent">http://microsoft.com/msagent</a>.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty described notebooks inside of other notebooks
    by referring to an internal file name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added a new option where Marty can speak and
    ToonTalk can display subtitles. If the -spoken_language command line option is used then
    the subtitles will be in a different language from the speech. Otherwise it will act like
    closed captioning.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added the ability to display multiple line subtitles

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/12</font>

    place - sometimes even off screen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the non-textual label of a notebook was
    sometimes invisible.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Remote controls that display pictures now follow the
    system-wide convention that space turns them on and '.' turns them off. This means only
    '+' advances them to the next state while previously space did that as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Remote controls whose appearance is textual now display an
    animated marquee only if they are active. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When running in some screen resolutions there were sometimes
    rectangular regions on the edge of the screen that were displayed wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot is running and types space at a picture or remote
    control when that doesn't make sense (i.e. not turning back on an inactivated sensor or
    picture) then a dialog box offers to make the robot type '+' instead since it was probably
    trained before the meaning of space was changed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a remote control was loaded so that it didn't
    update its value when it should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the geometry of the &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; sensors
    when removed from a box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a remote control when re-activated
    didn't update its appearance.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The notebook of a remote controls that flies out when you
    flip a picture over now includes a &quot;Copy of Me&quot; which is a fully-functional copy
    of the picture. One use of this is when you want to store or transport a picture you can
    get a complete copy of the picture and then destroy the original. This was a bad idea was
    removed on 2/8/00.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User defined sounds now just display the short version of the
    file name and not the long path.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the mouse is released via Control-F8 the Window title
    changes to indicate what has happened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when running ToonTalk in a window and leaving and
    returning to the window the color palette went bad and the colors were wrong until you
    paused and resumed ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you press Control-F8 to get the mouse back sometimes you
    lost the focus.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems saving empty text pads.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mouse clicks are now ignored if the mouse has been released
    via Control-F8.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if the window is the size of the screen
    when Control-F8 is pressed you couldn't resize or minimize the window.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how lines are broken in
    subtitles and talk balloons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the birthday puzzle when 2 languages are
    being used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a robot took something from a nest that
    occasionally caused a crash.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes things float over your hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where describing (either Marty or for the
    clipboard) an erased user picture caused problems.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes something is on top of
    something else and you stand up and sit and they were reversed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed more problems with puzzles when running with 2
    languages (spoken and textual).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot's name sometimes drifted off his chest. (Still
    happens but more rarely now.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a robot was given a name before
    being trained the name was lost.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the button of a tool like the wand would be placed
    wrong until the wand was pointed to.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Unicode text is broken into lines if it is a
    mixture of ASCII and Unicode characters.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the synchronization of text display and speaking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where extra empty lines in a puzzle confused
    ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Parenthetical remarks are now considered a good place to
    break a line.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">For the last 6 weeks when you changed an option and said it
    should apply to all users it only applied to new users.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a display glitch that occurred only at certain screen
    resolutions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos that started on a particular puzzle (e.g. using -puzzle
    on command line) didn't remember which puzzle they started on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how lines are broken in
    subtitles and talk balloons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F11 no longer saves a screen shot as frm&lt;frame
    name&gt;.bmp on the ToonTalk directory. But control-F11 does. Less likely to be typed
    unknowingly and freed up F11.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">F11 now means drop what you are holding but ignore what is
    underneath. So it won't go into a hole, or notebook page, and Bammer won't come out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Control-&lt;mouse click&gt; was interpreted the same as
    middle mouse click but not for middle mouse button sensor. Does now. Also Shift-&lt;mouse
    click&gt; now acts exactly like right mouse button click.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk crashed during puzzles
    sometimes when it was trying to report a problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that had broken puzzle 54 for several weeks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem getting screen shots while running demos.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a nest whose bird has been copied and then one of
    the copies destroyed (e.g. by dropping her on a notebook) started behaving strangely.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a nest that has been dropped on
    another nest (and &quot;bammed&quot; together).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that happened sometimes when the bird of a
    nest that has been bammed together with another nest is given something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when copies of a bird where given something
    to deliver to their nest at &quot;exactly the same time&quot;. Thanks to Miki for
    reporting this one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with a bird that is destroyed while still
    working (e.g. on the back of a picture that was dropped on a notebook while the bird was
    delivering a message).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements to how lines are broken in
    subtitles and talk balloons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a demo has completed it now runs the &quot;next
    demo&quot; if there is one whose file name is just the next numeric dmo. E.g. log2.dmo
    follows log1.dmo.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another problem that had broken puzzle 54 for several
    weeks.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving boxes whose label is 255 characters
    long. (254 characters is the limit.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk generated a warning that a
    robot was being saved that accessed holes of a box that were more than 255 when no such
    thing was happening.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you save something containing user pictures on the
    clipboard, the log file (&lt;user name&gt;.txt) now lists all the files that need to be
    sent along with the ToonTalk textual encoding.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a palette problem that occasionally happened when you
    pressed Control-F8 to release the mouse.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drag things to ToonTalk (while the mouse is released)
    then the focus is given to the ToonTalk window when you release the dragged files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The User section of toontalk.ini can now include entries for
    &quot;VariableFont&quot;, &quot;FixedFont&quot;, and &quot;SpokenLanguage&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty no longer tells you that you can use space to change
    pictures or remote controls since that is no longer true.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made more improvements to synchronizing text and speech.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the &quot;Parts&quot; sensor of a picture was placed on
    the back of a picture then ToonTalk crashed. (An infinite regress.) Thanks to Ross for
    reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the size of things while doing puzzles was strange.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures are no longer activated simply by dropping them. The
    space bar must be used.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now use tools (e.g. Dusty and Pumpy) with your hand
    hidden. Though the wand works even though it also becomes invisible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed another problem that had broken puzzle 54 for several
    weeks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug using mixed Unicode and ASCII text.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a bird is in a thought bubble it is as if it was erased
    since it matches any bird. So the label of the bird isn't displayed in thought bubbles.
    Thanks to Miki for bringing up this issue.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sensor in the Options notebook for how Marty speaks now
    includes the option &quot;speaks and subtitles&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the details of how a toss of a picture works. And it
    only works on the floor now - not when dropping the picture on another picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the geometry of a picture dropped on a remote
    control for the looks of a picture was wrong. Thanks to Ross for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you removed sensors from the flipside of a
    picture that was on the flipside of a picture, the sensor was tracking the wrong picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the remote looks of a picture didn't show the
    pictures that are on top of the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you type control-v to paste something in it no longer also
    gets added to a text pad or label or name of what you were pointing to or holding.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when training a robot to work on a box with many
    holes the box was partly off the edge of the screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If in a puzzle Marty is waiting for a bird to deliver
    something (currently only 54) and you bump into him, he no longer gives you a hint.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos where Marty speaks and uses subtitles sometimes didn't
    replay correctly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos that used the sensor for &quot;milliseconds since last
    frame&quot; didn't usually replay correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the reliability of saving pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">For quite a while the feature that the log file (&lt;user
    name&gt;.txt) shows which puzzle you started and ended with wasn't operating.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If only one voice is available then 'Set Options' no longer
    displays the option screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If no voices are available for a language then 'Set Options'
    canceled incorrectly when the voice selection screen was to be shown.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird was saved (without her nest) and the bird was in a
    box that was erased then when the box was dropped, ToonTalk got confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird on the back of a picture creates a nest the
    location is now better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way trained robots can manipulate parts and
    container sensors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way the &quot;Copy of Me&quot; sensor is updated
    when the picture if flipped over twice, changed, and then flipped over again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem copying a robot whose name has been erased.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the wiggle feedback when pointing to the remote
    control for the looks of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of multiple line subtitles.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copying an active picture now produces an active copy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that has broken puzzle 63 for 6 months.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unicode subtitles now look nicer.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the size of things on a nest was changed
    incorrectly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way teams of robots and loaded trucks looked
    when dropped in the hole of a box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a notebook on an erased number pad, it will
    receive the number of pages of the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the size of things on the back of a picture when
    flipped got stuck at very short but full width.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of teams of robots, especially teams
    with several members.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The size of robots in a team no longer need to be the same.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The appearance of which robot in a team is on top of another
    was improved.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running the last puzzle with 2 languages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made more improvements to the geometry of robot teams and
    robot names.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When sitting on the floor you can now once again see the
    walls when you bounce into them.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Marty tries to describe a force feedback joystick remote
    control (or one is placed on the clipboard) and no force feedback joystick is connected
    ToonTalk would sometimes crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some bugs with remote controls whose appearance are
    pictures inside of thought bubbles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text pads that have been flipped and saved were sometimes
    restored with the wrong text color.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text-to-speech sounds can now be erased and new text dropped
    on them. Or text can be dropped at the front or end to be added to what is said.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot on the back of a picture dropped a
    text pad on a text pad, Marty gave a warning about something not being somewhere when
    nothing was wrong.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where gaps appeared in boxes when ToonTalk
    was running at some screen resolutions (e.g. 1152 wide). Thanks to Tiago for reporting
    this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When holding something over the hole of a box with more than
    one hole then labels and the &quot;My box&quot; text didn't wiggle when the rest of that
    part of the box did.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You are now only asked once (per session) if you want to fix
    a robot that is using space on a picture or remote control in a meaningless manner.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes caused a crash while quitting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you type space to a picture or remote control that doesn't
    make sense then Marty gives a little help.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading some sensors that were saved in older
    versions of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture is inactive ('.' typed to it) it no longer
    animates.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture has a nest on the back and a remote control for
    the looks of the picture has been created then the birds of the nest got mixed up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally a bird on the back of a picture got frozen in
    flight.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally a bird on the back of a picture flying to a nest
    elsewhere on the back got mixed up and flew outside.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a bomb went off on a picture that was on a
    picture it ended up on the floor (rather than being destroyed).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally a bomb going off on the back of a picture on the
    back of a picture blew up ToonTalk instead.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused ToonTalk to crash sometimes
    trying to put up a trouble shooting dialog box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot was trained to use Dusty, he
    remembered the location to be vacuumed incorrectly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flipping a picture now inactivates it and all the things on
    its flip side. Flipping it back over doesn't restore things (maybe it should) so you need
    to press space to start it up again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally when a robot on the back of a picture flipped a
    picture over the notebook flew out from behind the back of the picture to end up on the
    floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots on the back of a remote control for the looks of a
    picture don't run. They are there only so you can add and remove them from the picture it
    controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture is inactivated or activated all its parts
    (things on top and on the back) are as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem putting up a dialog box while ToonTalk is
    shutting down.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a serious performance bug when a bird whose nest has
    been copied many times is given something and both the bird and her nests are off screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos did not replay correctly sensors reading the keyboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copies of user sounds and user pictures now take up much
    fewer resources and are faster.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if a robot is trained to flip a picture over
    and to vacuum up the picture's notebook of remote controls.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when something was on top of something else and the
    city was saved and restored they were reversed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The message box asking you if you want to see your log file
    (which is displayed only if ToonTalk thinks something important is in the log and 'Set
    Options' has indicated that the user is sophisticated) now displays in different
    languages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Unicode text (e.g. Japanese) includes spaces (ASCII 32)
    then these are interpreted as permissible places to break lines of text. They are not
    displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when Marty is speaking where subtitles or
    talk balloons disappeared or some text was skipped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a sensor which displays a picture displayed the
    picture in the lower left corner until it was pointed to or held.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem running a demo with a different number of
    languages (spoken and textual) than it was recorded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Semi-colon ';' is now considered when deciding where to break
    a line of text.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of text in talk balloons that has no
    line break characters in it. E.g. a file path.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally the replay of a demo where speech was enabled
    didn't replay correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A bird in a thought bubble no longer knows where its nest is.
    (Since while training you are in the robot's imagination.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem displaying small boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the internal format of demos so that they include
    more information and should replay even when run on a very different environment. They
    also keep a copy of the users notebook so the demo will run even if that has been changed
    since.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In some screen resolutions (e.g. 1152 wide) round off errors
    caused things to be noticeably displaced from where they should be. General improvement in
    calculating locations of displayed pictures. Thanks to Tiago for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you dropped a text pad on the &quot;File to Sound&quot;
    remote control the sound was played when Bammer smashed them together. No longer does this
    since it is inappropriate if a robot is trained to do this and there shouldn't be a
    difference between robot and programmer actions. You still of course can here the sound by
    typing space at it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a text pad is flipped over twice its size was
    strange.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the placement of a robot's thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User sounds used to load the WAV file when created or
    re-created. The time and resources devoted to this happens only the first time the sound
    is played. This means you can save many user sounds and it won't be costly unless they are
    all played. It does mean that if the file is missing or incorrect you'll get the warning
    when played rather than when loaded. User pictures work this way too.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User sounds can now be erased and a new file name dropped on
    them to convert them to a new sound. Or a text pad can be added to either end.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If demo logs are saved because GenerateLogs is set in
    toontalk.ini they now in appear in a subdirectory of Users whose name is the same as the
    user's name (without spaces and the like). Coming soon these logs will be broken into
    segments so you can jump back and forth through time.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you tried to vacuum a bird you were forced to vacuum her
    t-shirt label first. Now you can select either the entire bird or her label with Dusty.
    Thanks to Miki for pointing this out.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes very small boxes inside of things had too large a
    width and stuck out of whatever their container was.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Remote controls for the address that were inactivated (via
    '.') became temporarily active when a number was dropped on them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a text pad has robots on the back, then there was a
    problem with '.' and space which turn off and on the robots on the back that the
    characters couldn't be typed on the pad. Space and '.' now are do both turn on and off the
    text pad and add themselves to the pad. You can always type backspace to rub them out if
    you only want to turn them on and off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a picture is added to another picture it is activated in
    the process.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot trained to drop things on a notebook and then vacuum

    playing the puzzle game.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you turned off the power and then pressed F1 to send Marty

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/19</font> 

<ol>

    controls of a picture now presents a copy of the picture as it currently is (typically

    invisible barrier was over the city near the city's edge.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you are invisible none of the mouse or keyboard events
    changes you (e.g. walking out the door or sitting down). This means you can play games
    decorating the wall of a house or on the roof of a house.</font></li>

    in a team to have very big or small sizes.</font></li>

    user's BMP file) that this was trapped as an internal error (see 12/15 entry).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/27</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when ToonTalk was installed from an Internet
    download where some of the resolution options were enabled in 'Set Options' but they
    caused errors when ToonTalk was run since the m25 file is only available on the CD-ROM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The -v &lt;screen width&gt; command line was changed so that
    any number is accepted. The height is assumed to be 75% of the width. For example, there
    is no 'Set Option' for 1400x1050 but -v 1400 should run ToonTalk in that resolution (if
    the computer's video card and drivers support it).</font></li>

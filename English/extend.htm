<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk extensions are <a href="bird.htm">birds</a>
that can fly &quot;outside&quot; of ToonTalk to the operating system. You start off with
only one &quot;foreign&quot; bird. But she can bring you a bird connected to any ToonTalk
extension installed on your system. You can find her near the end of your <a
href="sensor.htm">sensor notebook</a>. She has a question mark on her T-shirt. To
&quot;open&quot; an extension, give her a box with 2 holes: the first should hold the name
of the extension and the second another bird who will come back with a new bird (in a
box). The kinds of messages (boxes), the new bird should be given depends upon which
extension she flies to.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Any programmer who can make Windows DLLs (Dynamic
Link Libraries) can <a href="extend2.htm">make new extensions</a>. Over time
we hope that programmers will add new extensions, for example, for generating 
music, or connecting to the Internet, or doing 3D graphics. Currently, only two <a href="extendin.htm">extensions
that can be installed</a>. One is for
<a href="http://www.weblabs.org.uk/wlplone/Members/michele/my_reports/Report.2004-02-04.4122/index_html">
controlling the LEGO Mindstorms RCX brick</a> and the other is for interfacing 
with the file system and is described below.</font></p>

<p><small><a name="FileExtension"></a></small><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>The
FILE extension.</b> This extension enables you to open files and read and write them. You
should give a bird connected to this extension a box with 3 holes. The first hole should
contain one of the message names listed below. The second hole should contain the name of
the file you want. The third hole should contain a bird who will receive a box with
another bird in it. This new bird will take messages to the file. </font>

<dl>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Create File.</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the first hole contains the words &quot;create
    file&quot;, then a file will be created for you. The second hole should contain the name
    of the file you want to create. A file with that name should not already exist. The name
    should follow the file naming rules of the operating system. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Open.</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the first hole contains the word
    &quot;open&quot;, then a file will be opened for you. The second hole should contain the
    name of a file that already exists. The file is opened using Windows <i>CreateFile</i>
    procedure. This means the name can be the name of a file, pipe, mail slot, communications
    resource (e.g. &quot;LPT1&quot; or &quot;COM1&quot;), disk device, console, or directory
    to open. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Open Serial Port.</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the first hole contains the words &quot;open
    serial port&quot;, then a serial port will be opened with the characteristics specified in
    the name found in the second hole. For example, if the second hole contains &quot;COM1:
    baud=1200 parity=N data=8 stop=1&quot; then the serial port number one of your computer
    will be opened with a 1200 baud rate, with parity off, 8 bit data, and stop equal to 1.
    This feature relies upon Windows <i>BuildCommDCB</i> procedure to interpret port
    descriptions. </font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Messages to Files. </b>After you successfully
opened or created a file, you should have a bird that flies to that file. She should have
the file name on her T-shirt. You can give her a message with 3 holes. The first hole can
be any of the message names listed below. The proper contents of the second hole depend
upon the first. The third hole should contain a bird who will receive a reply.</font> 

<dl>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Read</b>. </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The second hole should contain a number that says
    how many letters or characters to read. The bird is given a text pad with the letters
    read. If the end of the file was reached, then the number of letters will be less. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Write</b>. </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The second hole should contain a text pad to add to
    the file. The bird is given a number pad that shows the number of letters actually added
    to the file. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Read Bytes.</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The second hole should contain a number that says
    how many letters or characters to read. The bird is given a box with a hole for each
    character read. Inside each hole is the ASCII number for the character. If the end of the
    file was reached, then the number of letters will be less. </font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><b>Write Bytes.</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The second hole should contain a box with a hole for
    each byte to add to the file. Each hole should contain a number between 0 and 255. If a
    number is too large only the low order byte will be written. You can use the ASCII
    encoding of characters here. The bird is given a number pad that shows the number of
    letters actually added to the file. </font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The ability to read and write bytes is particularly
important when dealing with serial or parallel communication ports.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Where should program 
construction take place?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This may seem like a strange question. Some people 
construct programs on paper and then enter them into a computer. Some people 
type their programs into their favorite text editor. Other's use editors 
specialized for the programming language. Some programming languages support 
program construction from within the programming environment. A recent trend 
here is to use composable tiles representing program fragments as in Etoys and 
Alice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk is unique in that program construction 
takes place from within a game-like virtual world. It takes place not by 
supporting the editing of textual or pictorial programs from within a virtual 
world but instead by taking direct &quot;everyday&quot; actions in this world. The 
ToonTalk world is cute and playful and popular with pre-teens but it isn't a 
place where people spend much time for purposes other than constructing, 
debugging, and running ToonTalk programs. Some children spend many hours 
decorating houses, filling notebooks with artwork, playing with text-to-speech 
engines, and doing mathematical explorations with ToonTalk's exact rational 
arithmetic. But &quot;being there&quot; is rarely the main purpose of visiting the 
ToonTalk world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lately I have been thinking quite a lot about how 
persistent shared on-line virtual worlds fit into the big picture.
<a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> is a nice example of such a 
place where the &quot;residents&quot; have built a great variety of places and things in 
this world. <a href="http://www.opencroquet.org">Croquet</a> has a similar 
vision. About ten million people regularly visit such places [<a href="http://www.mmogchart.com/">here</a> 
is a great source of statistics about such places]. People visit these places 
primarily for entertainment and social reasons but there are some more
<a href="http://www.glsconference.org/pop/ondrejka.htm">&quot;serious&quot; activities</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What if one could construct programs from within 
these worlds in a manner similar to ToonTalk programming? It could be done in a 
way that is quite similar to how ToonTalk currently works. But with these 
differences:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>3D</b>. ToonTalk uses sprite animation and 2 
  1/2D graphics to provide a virtual world. This simplifies but limits things. 
  3D enables the explorations of many topics in science and mathematics. And 
  enables the programming of very popular classes of games. The challenge is to 
  make a 3D world that can be programmed by all.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Realistic physics</b>. Many virtual worlds 
  today have &quot;physics engines&quot; that support collisions, gravity, friction, rigid 
  body motion (with joints), and more. It is not reasonable to expect such 
  physics engines to be built by children. But they can be customized and 
  parameterized by all. A programmable world with a built-in physics engine 
  enables many explorations in sciences (e.g. sports science or mechanics). And 
  again opens up a whole new class of games that children can create.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Virtual communities</b>. Inhabitants of a 
  shared on-line virtual world can provide help to each other in ways that are 
  currently feasible only in face-to-face encounters. One can meet and build 
  things together. Someone half way around the world can help others build and 
  debug a program by being in the same place, manipulating the same objects, 
  conversing the whole time. People can collaborate in ways that are currently 
  much more awkward using web sites, email, and the like.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Living with your creations</b>. One is more 
  motivated to build things that work in the place where one spends one's time. 
  If people are inhabiting these spaces for reasons other than programming, then 
  programming becomes a tool for enhancing their &quot;living space&quot;. Their creations 
  are things they can enjoy while they are in a virtual world for social or 
  entertainment reasons, rather than objects that exist only when they are in 
  some programming system. Examples include virtual pets, useful gadgets, 
  kinetic sculptures, and long-lasting simulations.</font></li>

      <p>We recommend you install ToonTalk before running it. 
               Problems you are likely to encounter include:
         <ol>
            <li>
               Marty doesn't speak. Without installation the 
  built-in voice for Marty cannot be used. On some computers (those with 
  Microsoft SAPI 4.0 installed and text-to-speech voices) Marty can still speak 
  after selecting the voice using 'Set Options'.<li>
               The installation makes file type associations for file extensions 
               TT, CTY (city), DMO (demo), USR (user), and PZL (puzzle). Instead 
               of double clicking you'll have to drag these files to the 
               ToonTalk icon (StartTT on the CD-ROM in the ToonTalk folder) or 
               in some cases to a running ToonTalk image.<li>
               On some versions of Windows 95 and a few versions of 
                     Windows 98, it might not run at all without installation. Please report any 
                     problems if it doesn't run on Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or later.</li>
         </ol>

<p align="left">The following is  the introduction to the chapter in the book <em>The
Design of Children's Technology</em>, edited by Alison Druin, published by Morgan
Kaufmann, 1998.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Some children, when introduced to something new and complex, will jump in and explore
because they enjoy exploration and are good at it. Others are much more timid and will
explore only if coached or guided. Others ask for instructions and follow them
meticulously. Some children will carefully watch a demonstration, while others are
impatient to try things themselves.</p>

<p>It is possible that there is a style of learning that dominates others in effectiveness
and appeal. The position taken here, however, is that children differ, and that all these
learning styles have their place. Even an individual child may switch styles as
circumstances and experiences change.</p>

<p>Given the wide variety of ways that children learn, how should we design software for
children? This chapter attempts to answer this question by looking closely at our
experiences with the design and testing of ToonTalk®.</p>

<p>ToonTalk (Kahn 1996, 1998) is an animated world where children build and run programs
by performing actions upon concrete objects. The child builds real computer programs by
doing things like giving messages to birds, training robots to work on boxes, loading up
trucks, and using animated tools to copy, remove, and stretch items.</p>

<p>ToonTalk has been tested with 4th grade classes for the last 3 years. Initially, it
supported only an exploratory learning style. Some children quickly began exploring and
tried to figure out what each item does and how to combine them. Most, however, asked for
guidance. This led to the development of enhancements of ToonTalk that cater to children
with different learning styles. ToonTalk now includes a puzzle game that plays the role of
a tutorial. This appeals most strongly to children who tend to like to solve problems but
are less comfortable exploring on their own. An animated character named Marty was added
to ToonTalk that acts like a coach or guide in ToonTalk. Some children like to hear
suggestions from him and follow them. Others quickly send Marty away because they find him
annoying. A set of narrated demos of ToonTalk was created for those who like to sit and
passively be shown how to make things. Illustrated instructions on how to build some
programs were produced. These too appeal to a subset of the children. </p>

<p>Children of different ages, experiences, and learning styles approach the same software
in very different ways. The main lesson we can take away from this experience is that
children differ in the degree to which they are motivated and effective at exploring (on
their own or with an animated guide), or following instructions, or solving a puzzle
sequence. Even the same child will prefer different styles of interaction depending upon
her prior experience with the software. Ideally, a software program should be designed so
that a wide variety of children might enjoy and benefit from it.</p>

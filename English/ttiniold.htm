<p><strong><i><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">
<span style="background-color: #FF0000">These options are either for older 
versions of ToonTalk or are no longer recommended.</span> The current options 
are documented <a href="ttini.htm">here</a>.</font></i></strong></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">You may edit the toontalk.ini file to customize
ToonTalk. Beginning with version 2.52 and Beta 35 you'll find it in the ToonTalk
subdirectory of &quot;My Documents&quot;. Earlier versions of ToonTalk stored it in your
Windows directory. You can find out which version of ToonTalk you have by looking at the
opening screen. Additional options are available for making a <a href="instlini.htm">custom 
installation disk.</a></font><ul>
  <li><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>AutoDemoMaxIdle</b>. Value is number of seconds
    to wait before restarting demos when running -autodemo 1 or 2. </font></li>
  <li><a name="GeneralTextToSpeechEngine"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>GeneralTextToSpeechEngine</strong>.
    If its value is 1, then ToonTalk assumes that the text-to-speech engine can speak any
    utterance. With the built-in engine for Marty if you set this to 1, you'll hear Marty
    spelling many words he doesn't know how to say.</font></a></li>
  <li></il></il><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="ClippingDir"><strong>ClippingDir</strong></a>.
    If ClippingDir=&lt;a directory name&gt; is set in the Directories section of the
    toontalk.ini file then when ToonTalk puts something on the clipboard it also puts a copy
    in a file in ClippingDir with the users name (or if a city was put on the clipboard the
    users name followed by &quot;_city&quot;). This directory can be the desktop or a
    networked directory to simplify sharing. Or it can be set to &quot;a:&quot; to make it
    easier to give someone a floppy with a copy of clipboard encoding.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="FileSearchPath"><strong>FileSearchPath</strong></a>.
    When ToonTalk is looking for a file (e.g. a user's BMP file for a picture or WAV file for
    a sound), it looks in the Users subdirectory of ToonTalk (unless overridden by <a
    href="#UserFiles">UserFiles</a>). If it can't find a file there, it will search the
    directories listed in the FileSearchPath. FileSearchPath is a list of directories
    separated by commas. Each directory can be a full file path (e.g. c:\toontalk\pictures), a
    URL (e.g. http://www.toontalk.com/temp), or a relative path where * stands for the
    Users\&lt;user name&gt; directory so for a user named Sue with ToonTalk installed in the
    default location will be c:\program files\animated programs\toontalk\users\sue. For
    example, &quot;*\..\..\extra_sounds&quot; specifies a user defined directory named
    &quot;extra_sounds&quot; that is a direct subdirectory of the main ToonTalk directory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="SecondaryFileSearchPath"><strong>SecondaryFileSearchPath</strong></a>.
    This has the same meaning as the FileSearchPath but these directories are searched only if
    the directories specified by the FileSearchPath fail to contain the required files. This
    is particularly useful for <a href="localini.htm">local INI files</a>. This entry is
    operational in Beta 26 or version 2.34 or later.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="URLCacheDir"><strong>URLCacheDir</strong>.</a> If
    URLCacheDir=&lt;a directory name&gt; in the Directories section of the toontalk.ini file,
    then when URLs are read they are cached in the specified directory. Used in conjunction
    with FileSearchPath, you can post media needed by games or other ToonTalk applications on
    the web and they are copied to a the URLCacheDir as needed. If this isn't set then the
    system Internet file cache is used. This has the advantage and disadvantage that files are
    automatically deleted when old and space is needed. Requires Beta 23 or version 2.09 or
    later.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>MissingBuiltinPictureFileExtension</strong>. If this
    is set in the FileExtensions section of toontalk.ini then files with this extension will
    be used if BackgroundsDir or BuiltinPictureDir is set. Typical values are GIF, PNG, or
    JPG. Requires Beta 33 or 2.40 or later.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>MissingBuiltinPictureFileExtensionIf8Bit</strong>. If
    this is set in the FileExtensions section of toontalk.ini and you are running ToonTalk
    with 256 colors then files with this extension will be used if BuiltinPictureDirIf8Bit,
    BuiltinPictureDir, or BackgroundsDir is set. Typical values are GIF, PNG, or JPG. Requires
    Beta 35 or 2.52 or later.</font></li>

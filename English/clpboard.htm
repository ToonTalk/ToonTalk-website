<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><small>A common way to bring things
into ToonTalk is by using the Windows clipboard. The easiest way to do this is by using
control-c (holding down the control key (labeled 'Ctrl' on most keyboards) and 
then pressing 'c') to copy whatever you are holding into the clipboard. If you 
are on the floor and not holding anything then you'll put a copy of everything 
on the floor on the clipboard. If you are standing in a house then the entire 
house is put on the clipboard. If you are outside you'll copy the entire city. </small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><small>Once something is on the
clipboard you can paste it into any text editor or mail program. Control-v works as a
shortcut for nearly all programs. You can also paste it into another ToonTalk (or the same
one as an odd way to make a copy) using control-v. If you paste it into programs like Microsoft Word or
WordPad then be sure to save as text and not in Word format. If you are using 
unusual letters (e.g.&nbsp; ä) in labels or text pads then it is best to save as Unicode.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><small>If you save the clipping as a
file with the extension TT then when it is double clicked on the object in the clipping
will be added to your ToonTalk if paused. If no ToonTalk is running it'll start a new
ToonTalk. In either case the first time you sit on the floor the object will appear. 
If, instead, you save the clipping with the extension XML, you can inspect the 
internal format of ToonTalk objects using a web browser or other XML-capable 
tool.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><small>You can also use <a
href="sensor.htm#Clipboard">the clipboard sensor</a> to bring things into and out of
ToonTalk but most people find control-c and control-v quicker and easier. </small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><small>If you want to save 
something that includes pictures or sounds then it is better to click on 'Save 
to File' in the dialog that appears if you press Pause while holding something.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><small><b><strong>Advanced tip: </strong></b>You
can type control-c to a file when using the Windows Explorer (the desktop program). Then
when you type control-v to ToonTalk it'll import that file. If it is a picture you should
see the picture on the floor. If it is a sound then a sound. If it is a TT file then the
ToonTalk object. Otherwise the text of the file will appear as a ToonTalk text pad.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><small><b><strong>Advanced tip: </strong></b>
You can type control-c when pointing to a picture in a browser and then paste 
the picture into ToonTalk with control-v.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><small><strong>Advanced tip:</strong>
You can <a href="dragdrop.htm">drag one or more files</a> into ToonTalk at once.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><small><strong>Advanced tip:</strong>
If you hold down the shift key while typing control-v and the clipboard contains 
the name of a file or URL, then the contents of the file will appear in ToonTalk 
when you are on the floor.</small></font></p>

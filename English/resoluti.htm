      <P>What screen resolution do you want for ToonTalk?</P>
      <P>
         <INPUT id="Radio1" type="radio" value="1" name="RadioGroup">&nbsp;I want 
         ToonTalk to run with 320 by 240 pixels. It is OK that pictures will look grainy 
         since I want ToonTalk to run as fast as possible.
      </P>
      <form name="Buttons" ID="Form1">
         <P>
            <INPUT id="Radio2" type="radio" value="2" name="RadioGroup">&nbsp;I want 
            ToonTalk to run with 640 by 480 pixels. I still want ToonTalk to run fast but 
            not that grainy.
         </P>
         <P>
            <INPUT id="Radio3" type="radio" value="3" name="RadioGroup" CHECKED>&nbsp;I 
            want ToonTalk to run with 800 by 600 pixels. I want pictures to look sharper 
            and I want more space when I sit on the floor. I'll see if ToonTalk is slow.
         </P>
         <P>
            <INPUT id="Radio4" type="radio" value="4" name="RadioGroup">&nbsp;I want 
            ToonTalk to run with 1024 by 768 pixels. I want even sharper pictures and even 
            more space.
         </P>
         <P>
            <INPUT id="Radio5" type="radio" value="5" name="RadioGroup">&nbsp;I want 
            ToonTalk to run with 1152 by 864 pixels. I want more space.
         </P>
         <P>
            <INPUT id="Radio6" type="radio" value="6" name="RadioGroup">&nbsp;I want 
            ToonTalk to run with 1280 by 1024 pixels. I'll see if ToonTalk is fast enough 
            since I want all this space.
         </P>
         <P>
            <INPUT id="Radio7" type="radio" value="7" name="RadioGroup">&nbsp;I want 
            ToonTalk to run with 1600 by 1200 pixels. I want to see if my computer can run 
            in this resolution and if so will it be fast enough.</P>
         <P>If you make the screen resolution larger then the pictures will look sharp and 
            you'll have more room, but ToonTalk might run slow and the animation may become 
            jerky. I suggest you try different screen resolutions until you find the best 
            one for your computer.</P>

Abstract</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="4">Many of the attributes of 
good computer-based learning environments such as support for collaboration, 
creativity, and community are widely agreed upon. Interfaces should be seamless. 
Content should be challenging without being frustrating. Authoring support 
should be flexible and powerful.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="4">But what about <i>
<span style="color: teal">universality </span></i>in learning environments? 
Should learning environments support the specification and execution of 
arbitrary computations? And if one does support universality, should it be for 
more than just expert users?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="4">I argue here that 
universality for all is both desirable and attainable. Furthermore, by 
universality I mean more than a theoretic equivalence to a Turing Machine, but 
rather an elegant and cognitively appropriate model of general computations. The 
classical notion of universality only addresses the ability to compute the 
values of functions, ignoring the ability to effectively use the input and 
output devices typically associated with desktop computers. Ideally, learners 
should be able to describe computations, including those involving the display, 
mouse, keyboard, or sound card. And they should be able to describe those 
computations in a language that is well-suited to their cognitive abilities.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="4">A computer becomes whatever 
software instructs it to be. A learning environment that does not restrict the 
range of software that can be created and run is able to exploit all that a 
computer can be. Most learners can find something that is personally compelling 
among the literally millions of different kinds of things a computer can be. 
Software is a fundamentally new kind of medium. It is a medium where one 
expresses ideas that are given life by machines called computers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="4">Ideally, educational software 
should be <i>transparent</i>. To be transparent, software needs to be composed 
of modules that can be understood and <i>changed</i> by students as well as 
authors.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="4">Previous attempts to provide 
universal universality (i.e., fully general computational tools for everyone) 
have had limited success. Logo [Papert 1980] and Smalltalk [Kay 81] both strive 
to be general purpose programming languages for all. To master these languages 
or their successors (e.g. Boxer [Boxer 02], StarLogo [Resnick 1997], and Squeak 
[Squeak 02]) requires a set of skills that many students fail to acquire. To 
program in these languages one needs to be fluent in a set of computational 
abstractions (e.g. procedures, variables, and conditionals). And programs are 
constructed in the realm of abstract variables and not concrete values. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><font size="4">Everyone, however, can master 
tools capable of constructing arbitrary computations. (By "everyone" I mean 
students who are capable of learning other school subjects.) ToonTalk ([Kahn 
96], [Kahn 02]) is a programming environment that greatly lowers the difficulty 
of programming without sacrificing power or expressibility. It does this by 
replacing computational abstractions with tangible concrete analogs and by 
supporting the ability to program with examples and subsequently remove details 
to obtain generality.</font></p>

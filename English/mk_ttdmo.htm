<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After running ToonTalk with <a href="ttravel.htm">
time travel enabled</a>, you'll find a file named time_travel.dmo in your 
ToonTalk user directory (typically a directory with your name that is a 
subdirectory of ToonTalk that is a subdirectory of My Documents). Copy and 
rename it but be sure to keep the DMO file extension. This file can be 
distributed to anyone who has the same version of ToonTalk installed. It can be 
linked to from a web page. When clicked upon this file will replay the time 
travel log. The <a href="ttravel.htm">time travel VCR-like controls</a> will 
appear when you move the mouse.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">A DMO file is internally a zip archive that 
contains several lognnnnn.dmo files (one for each time travel segment) and a 
0.xml file that contains some extra information. You can 
use any of the
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=zip+utilities">
common zip utilities</a> to add subtitles, text-to-speech, or narration to a 
time travel archive by unzipping the DMO file and adding your files. You may find it is easiest to temporarily rename the file to have a ZIP 
file extension while making any of the following enhancements to your demo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding subtitles to your demos</b>.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk starts
running a time travel demo named X it looks for a file named X.ust. (&quot;ust&quot; is the default
extension name for American English subtitles - in general the extension is the two-letter
country code followed by 't'. British English is &quot;ukt&quot;.) You can override the default for your computer by providing
an &quot;<a href="ttini.htm#SubtitlesSuffix">SubtitlesSuffix</a>&quot; entry in the &quot;FileExtensions&quot; section of the
ToonTalk.ini file in your Windows directory. A subtitle file is made of entries separated
by a blank line. Each entry has the time in milliseconds since the beginning of the demo
followed by the text of the subtitle. It is recommended that any lines of text more than
60 characters be broken. The &quot;demos&quot; subdirectory of your ToonTalk installation
has many sample subtitle files. One way to obtain the millisecond timings is to press F9
while the demo is playing back. This will record the time in your &lt;user name&gt;.txt log
file in the &quot;users&quot; subdirectory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">One you have your UST file (or UKT, SET, PTT, JPT, 
...) you should add it to the DMO file (it is a zip archive).</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding narration to your demos</b>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The narration needs to be as either a single large 
WAVE file or several smaller files. WAVE files are the Microsoft Windows 
standard audio file and they usually have the WAV extension. Note that currently 
the WAVE file cannot be compressed as an MP3 or Windows Media file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">A single WAVE file will typically be larger than 
several smaller WAVE files since there is no playback of quiet periods. Also 
very large WAVE files may cause some performance problems. Currently ToonTalk 
can only playback a WAVE file from the beginning so if during playback one uses 
the VCR controls to jump into the middle of a narration you won't hear it. Until 
ToonTalk is enhanced to play the sound files from any starting location, the 
best alternative is to break your file into smaller pieces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You specify when you want a wave file to begin 
playback during a demo by adding to your subtitle file an XML fragment such as:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1412<br>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br>
&lt;SoundFile&gt;UK\s01.wav&lt;/SoundFile&gt;</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This indicates that 1.412 seconds into the demo 
that ToonTalk should begin to play the sound file in the DMO archive named 
UK\s01.wav. If you anticipate making different language versions of your demo we 
recommend you use a folder name for each version. Alternatively you can keep all 
the files at the top level of the zip archive and give them names like 
UK_s01.wav. If you only want to have 
narration without subtitles then the above can be the entire contents of your 
subtitles file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wish to have narration generated by the 
same text-to-speech engine that Marty uses, you can add an entry such as</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1412<br>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br>
&lt;TextToSpeech&gt;Welcome to my demo.&lt;/TextToSpeech&gt;</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">An Example:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here is the beginning of the intro_v2.ust in the 
intro_v2.dmo used in ToonTalk 3:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1412<br>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br>
&lt;SoundFile&gt;US\s01.wav&lt;/SoundFile&gt;<br>
<br>
1412<br>
Hello! Welcome to ToonTalk.<br>
I'm Pat and I'll be happy to show you around.<br>
<br>

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br>
&lt;SoundFile&gt;US\s02.wav&lt;/SoundFile&gt;<br>

<b>Tips:</b></font> </p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Avoid using keyboard accelerators for tools (e.g. 'e' to make
    Dusty erase things). These accelerators differ from language to language so if you use
    them your demos probably won't work in a different language version of ToonTalk. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are creating a demo on a fast computer and expect the
    demo to be run on slower machines then it is recommended that you add <a
    href="command.htm#FrameDurationMinimum">-y 50</a> (or a similar number) to the command
    line while recording to slow down your machine. We also recommend if you are 
  making a demo that will run on slower computers to switch to a lower screen 
  resolution before recording it (e.g. 800x600).</font></li>
  <li><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If your demo includes your 
  own sounds or pictures then enable
  <a href="ttini.htm#IncludeMediaInTimeTravelArchives">
  IncludeMediaInTimeTravelArchives</a> so that the media files are included in 
  the DMO file.</font></span></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If your demo works only in a particular version 
  of ToonTalk then if you add the ToonTalk executable (e.g. TT345.exe) to the 
  DMO file ToonTalk will use this version when replaying the demo. Note that 
  this will not work if the EXE is a later version than was installed and other 
  files are needed to run this version.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have a script (e.g. the subtitles) 
  before recording the time travel session you can see the subtitles while 
  recording. To do so, place a copy of the script in the Demos subdirectory of 
  the ToonTalk installation and name it time_travel.ust (or UKT etc.). Record a 
  few seconds and exit ToonTalk. Then when you come back you'll see the 
  subtitles. To enable this feature add SubtitlesAndNarrationEvenWithoutDemo=1 
  to the Switches section of toontalk.ini.</font></li>
  <li>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">

  If your demo includes Marty speaking then don't have Marty use subtitles 
  since then they can't be added to the demo as well. The talk balloon is a good 
  alternative (with or without text-to-speech).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can create a video or animation of a demo by creating
    series of <a href="scrnshot.htm">screen snapshots</a>.</font></li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><big><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">Loading Playground games into
ToonTalk prior to version 2.35 or Beta 27</font></big></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have ToonTalk version 2.35 or Beta 27 or
later then you the following should happen automatically when you click on things in
Internet Explorer while browsing <a
href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground/gameplace/gamelist.htm">The Game Place</a>. If
something goes wrong (which it does in some circumstance when using Netscape Navigator)
then you'll have to do the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't have the Playground sounds and pictures you
should add (or edit) the <a href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a> entry in
the Directories section of your <a href="ttini.htm">toontalk.ini file</a> (on c:\windows
or c:\winnt) as follows:</font></p>

<p>FileSearchPath=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground/media;http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground/ttlibrary/playgrounds</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">which tells ToonTalk to look on the Playground web site for
any missing files. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first time you load a game (by simply clicking on the
picture on the game at <a href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground/gameplace/gamelist.htm">The
Game Place</a>), you should be <em>patient</em> as ToonTalk loads the needed files over
the Internet. (ToonTalk will appear to freeze as the files are loaded - there are plans to
improve this in coming releases.) These files are cached (in the same place that Internet
Explorer caches such files) so the second time you load the game it should be much faster
(unless you've loaded many other things subsequently). If you rather be sure that the
second time you load a game it will go fast (and will work even if you are no longer
connected to the net), then make the following changes to the Directories section of
toontalk.ini by adding entries for <a href="ttini.htm#FileSearchPath">FileSearchPath</a>
and <a href="ttini.htm#URLCacheDir">URLCacheDir</a>:</font></p>

<p>FileSearchPath=*\..\..\downloads;http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground/media;http://www.ioe.ac.uk/playground/ttlibrary/playgrounds
<br>
URLCacheDir=*\..\..\downloads;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This ensures that the files loaded off the Internet are
saved in the &quot;toontalk\downloads&quot; directory. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Note that a few games use artwork which is copyrighted and
not available from the Playground web site.</font></p>

<p class="Style1" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Great minds 
ranging from Zeno to Galileo found the concept of infinity puzzling and 
difficult to understand. A deep understanding of infinity had to wait until 
Cantor’s discoveries in the second half of the nineteenth century. Cantor’s 
theorems that the set of all integers, the set of all positive integers, the set 
of all positive even numbers and even the set of all rational numbers all have 
the same cardinality (while the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is of a 
higher cardinality) are not usually introduced to students until advanced high 
school or university mathematics courses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: black">The general 
assumption that infinity is too abstract for young children is hardly 
surprising. T</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt">here are deep 
mathematical waters to be navigated, and it may seem impossible to make much 
headway without an appropriate formalism with which to express ideas. The 
existing formalisms are static and difficult for most students (see, for 
example, Monaghan, 2001; Tall, 2001; Tsamir, 2001). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt">This paper describes an attempt to 
help children approach these ideas, by providing them with an appropriate 
alternative <span style="color: black">formalism</span> with which to think and 
talk about ideas like these. Our hypothesis is that via carefully-designed 
computational explorations within an appropriately constructed medium, infinity 
can be approached in a learnable way that does not sacrifice the rigour inherent 
in the concept. The curious child can learn some deep, interesting, and 
different <span style="color: black">mathematics without first having mastered 
more advanced mathematics.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt">We will describe how children 
explored concepts of cardinality of infinite sets by interpreting and 
constructing computer programs in ToonTalk. Children programmed infinite or 
non-terminating processes that produce infinite sequences including the natural 
numbers, the even numbers, the integers, and the rational numbers. They
<span style="color: black">show constructively the one-to-one correspondence 
between the corresponding sets of numbers.</span><span style="color: #993366">
</span>Our field studies have supported the hypothesis that children can build 
useful intuitions of infinity by constructing and manipulating infinite 
processes and the computational objects that hold the eternally growing 
sequences produced by these processes.</span></p>

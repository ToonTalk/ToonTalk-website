    feedback when entering text such as Japanese.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/17</font>

    of numbers.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem undoing (via F11) the dropping of a box on an

    something that isn't rectangular after is has been flipped over.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when you dropped a large box on a number one of the
    resulting parts was off screen. No longer.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/23</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The size of the text within Marty's talk balloon is now
    calculated taking into account the size of the balloon.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance and speed of boxes with a large
    number of holes.</font></li>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of number pads being dropped on a stack

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a city or object that contained erased
    numbers with the same original value.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug displaying very large boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved generally the display of very large things (e.g.
    bigger than a house).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the last hint that Marty gives for puzzle 13. (He
    referred to a box with 3 zeros instead of 6 zeros.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The handling of objects that don't fit on the floor of the
    house has changed. They are no longer automatically shrunk to fit inside the house. If you
    stand up you may see large objects stick out the door or through walls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the code that ensures that an object will stay
    on the screen if Pumpy shrinks it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pumpy now works correctly on very large objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way pads are displayed if they are at twice the
    width of the screen and both ends are off screen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of large objects on the ground. (They
    sometimes ended up moved or their changed in drastic ways.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced when Bammer got the ability to undo
    his work when you press F11. Could cause occasional crashes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying the background color of a pad that
    is being pointed to when running in 8-bit color mode.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a big where you could pickup or use a tool on a very
    large objects (e.g. several blocks long).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Text and number pads no longer get shorter when viewed from
    the helicopter.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Marty speaks numbers, especially very long
    ones.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The total length of text pads can now exceed 64K (65536).
    Pads longer than 64K will be truncated to 64K when saved to the clipboard or in a city.
    This will be fixed in the next release.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed an old option about the serial port since that only
    worked in the 16-bit version of ToonTalk that is frozen at version 1.04.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made the appearance of arithmetic operations (e.g. multiply
    by 5) a&nbsp; different from numbers.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/14</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Arithmetic errors (such as divide by zero) are now handled
    when Bammer smashes the numbers together rather than when dropped. The old scheme required
    some computations to be done twice and was hard to maintain with the new features for
    arithmetic.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the good size (e.g. when Pumpy is set to 'G') of an
    erased text pad to not be wide enough for the text that it had before being erased.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of boxes when seen from the
    helicopter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the calculation of the size of Marty's talk balloon
    and the text inside. Especially when running at resolution greater than 800x600.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem training a robot when its box contained a
    remote control for the looks of a picture and the remote controls had been flipped to
    control the back of the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of very large objects that are on the
    ground (outside).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the calculation of the &quot;good size&quot; (e.g. when
    Pumpy is set to 'G') for very long text or number pads.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a rare problem with saving cities or complex objects
    when the toontalk.ini switch DumpCopiesCompactly is non-zero. The problem caused a variety
    of symptoms.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finished <a href="newnum.htm">a major enhancement to the way
    arithmetic is done</a> in ToonTalk. Click here for details.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The rule for whether a number is exact now has an exception
    if the operation is &quot;=&quot;. In this case the result is exact if the number with the
    &quot;=&quot; operation is exact.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a situation where a remote control for the looks of a
    number no longer responded to keyboard events.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of numbers when taken out of
    Tooly the Toolbox.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs with the new implementation of numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Inexact numbers that internally rely upon double floating
    point numbers now deal better with extreme values (so-called infinity when such numbers
    exceed 10^380).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem restoring cities that
    were saved with numbers on the floor.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Inexact numbers that are converted to a large integer or
    exact rational are still inexact (and display with gray text by default).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">25/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes a large number moved a long
    distance when its value changed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now rubout an operation on zero to produce a
    &quot;naked&quot; operation. This operation can be given a new value by dropping it on a
    number or dropping a number on it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling when an erased number is dropped
    on a number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems with the display of very long numbers
    (over 10,000 digits).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">26/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a number's value change it used to always keep its
    center position the same. Now this is only if the number is completely visible on screen.
    Otherwise it doesn't move.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">27/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a number has more than 5,000 digits, ToonTalk can freeze
    for a few seconds or longer computing the decimal version of the number. The first time
    this happens you now get a dialog box offering to give you <a href="slownumb.htm">help</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added two new operations for computing the natural log and
    the log base 10 of a number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way very long numbers on the floor are
    displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the ability to change the base (or radix) of a
    number. If you have a text pad with an integer between 2 and 36 then typing '#' turns the
    integer into zero of the base it previous was. For example, typing &quot;8#&quot; produces
    &quot;8#0&quot; and then typing &quot;100&quot; produces 64 in base 8 or
    &quot;8#100&quot;. When two numbers are combined in any way the base of the number
    underneath is used to display the result.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the way notebooks were saved in demo log
    files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored the old way of displaying bit-wise operations like
    '&amp;' (and) and '|' (or).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way very long text pads are displayed. Some
    aesthetic problems remain if the font is variable width and the text is much wider than
    the screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored the calculation of the size of the font used in
    various parts of ToonTalk to the way it worked prior to January 5, 2002.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of very tiny text.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced in January saving and restoring
    joystick remote controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If &quot;BackgroundsDir&quot; is not set in toontalk.ini but
    &quot;BuiltinPictureDir&quot; is set then ToonTalk acts as if BackgroundsDir was set to
    the same directory as BuiltinPictureDir.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made changes to where ToonTalk looks for various files so
    that the latest version of ToonTalk can be installed in the same directory as any old
    version and both will work fine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the error handling when an erased number or <a
    href="newnum.htm#OperatorsWithoutValues">an operation with no arguments</a> is dropped on
    a text pad.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now correctly describes the random number remote
    control as producing numbers between 0 and 999 (not 0 and 1000).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Also updated the way Marty talks about to change the
    visibility sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a sensor sometimes stopped displaying
    its up-to-date state when inside a box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some sensors can now take on any value including rational or
    inexact values. These are the sensors for a picture's x and y position, x and y speed, and
    width and height. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/3 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of explicit addition and subtraction.
    Previously you really implicitly added positive or negative numbers. Now you can construct
    an operation which is a subtraction or addition by creating an <a
    href="newnum.htm#OperatorsWithoutValues">operation with no arguments</a> (e.g. by rubbing
    out '*0') and then typing '+' or '-'. These can be <a
    href="newnum.htm#CompositeOperations.">combined as operations</a> now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty now correctly describes operations with no arguments.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the handling of rubout ('Backspace') of large
    integers and rational numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving large integers and rational numbers
    that have been erased.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you turn off a sensor (e.g. by typing '.' to it) and then
    change its value any copies of the sensor are changed as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of an attempt to flip over a numeric
    remote control.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of keyboard events to numeric remote
    controls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of numeric remote controls when the
    picture they are connected to is missing (destroyed, in Dusty, or on the back of a
    picture).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Spurious warnings are no longer placed in the log file when
    force feedback effects are encountered and no force feedback joystick or mouse is
    connected.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk handles much better very slow speeds for pictures.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a command line option &quot;-integer_positions 0&quot;
    which causes position sensors of pictures to display many digits after the decimal point.
    Is annoying even if it shows reality better than truncated integers so is off by default.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Numeric sensors always display in black text since they are
    never inexact. The reality they are measuring is inexact so the sensor is accurately
    displaying reality.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way large integers and rational numbers are
    saved to be much faster and take less disk space.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some bugs in the Java applet generator introduced by
    the handling of new kinds of numbers. (Note that Java applets are still generated to work
    with 64-bit integers but constants in the Java applet are still limited to 32-bit
    integers. Will be fixed.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed bugs in force feedback effects introduced by the
    handling of new kinds of numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the calculation of non-integer powers.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where numbers on the
    floor of a saved city were restored with different sizes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some recently introduced bugs when the speed remotes of
    a picture were changed to work with any kind of number. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a name="Beta34b">Released Beta 34</a>.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the display of number pads when the font is just a
    few points.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem calculating the size of text and number pads
    when running in at screen resolution that is does not divide evenly by 32000x24000. E.g.
    1024x786.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying numbers after many digits were
    typed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of files in the temporary file cache
    that are local copies of remote URLs. Particularly important in finding local ini files
    associated with URLs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem pasting strings into ToonTalk that contain
    '.'. Introduced in the last month or two.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying text pads that under some
    circumstances didn't display some of the rightmost text. Introduced in the last month or
    two.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture or sound is brought into ToonTalk by copy and
    paste from Internet Explorer then the picture remembers the URL not the location of the
    copy of the URL in the temporary file cache.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the command line -city is used with a file name that
    contains spaces then ToonTalk wasn't able to find an associated local ini file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the command line -city is used with a short file name then
    it is found in the Users directory but the associated local ini file is not.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes numbers that were off screen and have grown longer
    so that they are partially on-screen were not displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you quit after solving a puzzle that ended with a number
    in your hand then when you resumed the number was very tiny.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem altering the color of things (e.g. to
    indicate selection) when running with 24-bit color.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The component in a robot's thought bubble that most recently
    failed to match is now displayed in red.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a nest is in a robot's thought bubble box and it matches a
    corresponding nest then if there is a match failure later during the robot's match, he
    suspended rather than failed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the text of a negative number was pasted into ToonTalk it
    became the operation of subtracting the absolute value of the number. Not only did it
    display differently than negative numbers but this broke puzzle number 6. Thanks to Rich
    Burridge for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems altering the color when running in 32-bit
    color mode.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/28</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released Beta 34b mainly due to the severity of the bug fixed
    on 3/26 that breaks puzzle #6.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta35"><font face="Comic Sans MS">3/29</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the pixels closest to the
    edge of the screen were wrong. Previously these pixels were covered by a gray frame.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caused by ToonTalk being installed to a
    directory whose path is more than about 120 characters long.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Re-wrote the code to find special paths such as &quot;My
    Documents&quot; to work on all 32-bit versions of Windows.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the directory that ToonTalk uses to store user files does
    not exist, ToonTalk now creates it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">User created demos and Java applets are now stored as
    subdirectories of the ToonTalk user directory. Previously these were subdirectories of the
    directory where ToonTalk is installed but limited users (e.g. non-administrators in
    Windows 2000 or non power users in Windows XP) cannot write.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The default users directory is now the ToonTalk subdirectory
    of My Documents. This is also the expected location of the toontalk.ini file. If missing,
    the old location in the Windows directory is searched.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Files written by ToonTalk now follow the Windows XP
    guidelines regarding the use of personal and shared folders.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">An expired beta or trial version of ToonTalk will still run
    demos if the demo files are double clicked. As before demos launched the usual way ran
    even if expired.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some situations where ToonTalk had troubles describing
    the new rational numbers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a potential problem in how Marty jumps around to stay
    away from your hand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a team of robots that is currently
    running on the floor.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the ClickMe.exe program that runs when the CD-ROM is
    inserted to follow the Windows XP guidelines about where user files are kept.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the scheme for giving selection feedback and
    scrolling to respond a frame earlier. On a typical system this is 20 to 50 milliseconds
    sooner.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the accuracy of selecting things from compartments
    of Tooly the Toolbox.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Under some circumstances when on the floor close to a wall,
    the wall obscured part of Tooly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the top or bottom row of pixels wasn't
    refreshed correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a potential problem displaying a wall when sitting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a performance bug that depended upon round off due to
    different screen resolutions. (Some objects were unnecessarily scaled by 1/2 percent.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When help is launched from the Start ToonTalk program, it is
    now displayed maximized.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new toontalk.ini Switch called
    AbsoluteMouseMode. If set to 1 then mouse is treated in a new way that is particularly
    well-suited for tablet computers and touch screens. The default value is 0. Details <a
    href="absolute.htm">here</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new toontalk.ini Switch called ShowMouseCursor.
    If set to 1 the mouse cursor will be visible. Particularly useful when trying
    AbsoluteMouseMode=1 with a mouse.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced a new toontalk.ini Switch called
    AllowMultipleToonTalks. Prior to this change if ToonTalk was started while another
    ToonTalk was running and different user names were used then both ToonTalks would be
    running on the computer. Since this frequently caused confusion to children, the default
    behavior is now that only one ToonTalk can run per computer. AllowMultipleToonTalks is 0
    by default. If AllowMultipleToonTalks is set to 1 then a new ToonTalk is created even if
    one is running (and even if it has the same user name).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/26</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated ClickMe.exe which is run when the CD-ROM is inserted
    to deal properly with the new location for the toontalk.ini file. If it is not in the My
    Documents\ToonTalk directory but is on the Windows directory then it is copied to where it
    should be.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further changes to follow the Windows XP guidelines
    regarding the location of user files.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the Start ToonTalk program to use HTML dialogs when
    possible. (When not possible it reverts back to the old dialogs.) This enables easy
    customization and localization. And it looks nicer and is easier to use. Click <a
    href="dialogs.htm">here</a> for more details.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ClickMe.exe now also uses HTML dialogs when possible. In
    ToonTalk.ini in the Executables section is a new key called HTMLClickMe. If this is set to
    a path to an HTML file then this dialog will be displayed when the CD-ROM is inserted.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/3 </font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made major improvements to the new absolute mouse mode for
    tablets and touch screens.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way arrow keys work if used while in absolute
    mouse mode. Among the changes is that while flying the helicopter the up and down arrow
    moves the helicopter up or down not north and south as it does when in relative mouse
    mode.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced earlier this year that
    occasionally caused the text in Marty's talk balloon to be tiny.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the ability to drag things in absolute mouse mode.
    (E.g. when using a tablet to use the pen to move an object around continuously.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while in absolute mouse mode you made the window nearly
    full screen, it would attempt to switch to full-screen. (Also true in relative mouse mode
    when the mouse has been released via control-F8.) It no longer does this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced two new customizations to toontalk.ini. If the
    User section has a value for RunCharacter then this character is used rather than the
    space bar to turn things on. The value of StopCharacter is used to stop things instead of
    using period. Note that you can indicate unusual characters by typing their name within
    angle brackets. E.g. RunCharacter=&lt;tab&gt; while make the tab key start tools and
    robots on the back of pictures. Particularly useful for tablet PCs without keyboards but
    with some keys available.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes occurred when something is
    dropped on something else and then grabbed before Bammer smashes them together.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of Marty and his talk balloon
    if a city was saved while on the ground and Marty was talking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Used to be that keystrokes caused you to sitting while
    walking indoors but not outside. Now you sit in either case.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the stability of an object's location as it goes
    through a built-in animation cycle.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If walking with something your pocket and you pause and
    select 'Come Back Later' then a Java applet was produced. This now only happens if you
    pause while holding something on the floor.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems generating Java applets that arose in Beta 34
    due to the change in how numbers work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Erased numerical sensors used to update their value even
    though it couldn't be seen. No longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the ability to give selection feedback by changing
    colors when running with more than 256 colors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problem running with 16-bit color.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems using the toontalk.ini Switch called
    DesiredFullScreenBitsPerPixel.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the geometry of Marty's talk balloon
    when loading a city that have been saved while Marty was displaying a talk balloon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When running in full-screen mode and another program gets the
    focus (e.g. by typing alt-tab) then if in absolute mouse mode ToonTalk is switched to
    window mode. And then maximizing the window will restore true full-screen mode. This is
    not how it works when in relative mouse mode since in that mode ToonTalk requires
    exclusive control of the mouse.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If after switching from full-screen to windowed while either
    in absolute mouse mode or relative mouse mode with the mouse released (control-F8) then if
    the window is moved or reshaped then the next time during the same session that ToonTalk
    is switched to windowed mode it will use the last position and dimensions for the window.
    Useful on tablet PCs for frequently switching from full-screen to windowed (e.g. to use a
    virtual keyboard).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with absolute mouse mode with windows that are
    not the same dimensions internal screen resolution. E.g. those reshaped after launch.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to send an improper keystroke to a
    tool then it makes a plop sound. It now only makes the plop sound if the robot is being
    watched (i.e. running on the floor where you are). Fixed other situations where tools make
    sounds used off screen.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk is running at 320x240 then it switches the old
    format (limited to 8-bit color). Useful for very old computers.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added HTML dialogs to the main ToonTalk program. Click <a
    href="dialogs.htm">here</a> for details.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Demos created by &quot;-o&quot; on the command line are now
    created in the Demos subdirectory of the user's directory under My
    Documents\ToonTalk\&lt;user name&gt;. However, demos run by &quot;-i&quot; on the command
    line find the demos in the ToonTalk installation's Demos subdirectory. To be shared with
    all they must be copied to the ToonTalk directory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">By default the new HTML dialogs are maximized. The new
    toontalk.ini Switches called DialogWidth, DialogHeight, DialogLeft and DialogTop can be
    used to specify the size and location for dialogs from the main ToonTalk program.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">All &quot;message box&quot; style dialogs are now HTML as
    well.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made further improvements in ToonTalk's ability to switch
    from full-screen to window and back.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Reduced the occurrence of DirectX errors if the video mode is
    changed while ToonTalk is minimized.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/7</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when a robot is trained to vacuum up the
    notebook of a flipped over picture. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changing the option that controls whether running full-screen
    and if not the size of the window now happens immediately. Previously Marty warned that
    this wouldn't take effect until the next time you started ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes flipped pictures when saved,
    restored, and then flipped back had the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if two remote controls for the looks of
    the same picture were flipped over and one flipped back that the notebook of sensors for
    the picture went away.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/10</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Control-F8 to release control of the mouse makes no sense in
    absolute mouse mode and is now ignored unless in relative mouse mode.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In absolute mouse mode you can now sit in the house by
    clicking near the bottom of the window.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/11</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mouse force effects are now stopped when pausing or quitting
    ToonTalk. (Only noticeable when flying.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems putting up dialog boxes while exiting
    ToonTalk. (E.g. one that suggests you might want to change the screen resolution.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now get up from the floor in absolute mouse mode by
    clicking on the north wall.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem using the Magic Wand in absolute mouse mode
    that required extra mouse clicks.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when &quot;scrolling&quot; (i.e., camera
    moves) on the floor in absolute mouse mode while holding something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of what is on the wall of the house
    in puzzles&nbsp; #15, #23, and #24.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made major speed improvements to the code that changes the
    color of things to indicate selection or power off. Still pretty slow when running in
    16-bit color mode.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The dialog to 'Set Options' is now in HTML as well as all the
    other dialogs.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can now drag something to the edge of the screen while
    sitting in absolute mouse mode and the camera will move (i.e., you'll scroll).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem in &quot;Kiosk mode&quot; where ToonTalk
    tries to relaunch Start ToonTalk and has an error.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduce a new toontalk.ini entry for the Directories
    section called BuiltinPictureDirIf8Bit. And a new entry for Extensions called
    MissingBuiltinPictureFileExtensionIf8Bit. These can be used to specify image files
    specially appropriate for running in 256 color mode.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/20</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a missing sentence to the final hint that Marty gives
    for puzzle #9. Thanks to Jeff Smith for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where there was a column or row of pixels
    around the subtitle bar that wasn't painted black.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a file named something.htm.tt or something.html.tt (where
    something can be any valid file name) is opened (e.g. double clicked) then it is launched
    as a dialog from Start ToonTalk. This is a nice way of having specialized pages for
    updating or customizing some features.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when providing Start ToonTalk a command line
    that ended with a ToonTalk extension (&quot;tt&quot;, &quot;pzl&quot;, &quot;dmo&quot; and
    so on).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes the HTML dialogs were not
    positioned correctly on the desktop.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes ToonTalk was not restored
    properly after an interruption.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/25</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various new dialog bugs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 35 released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta35g"><font face="Comic Sans MS">6/29</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">On some systems after returning from the dialog showing that
    ToonTalk is paused ToonTalk is no longer tracking the mouse movements.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/2</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems saving very large numbers and reloading
    them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems adding things to a notebook that was created
    in an earlier version of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 6/11 that sometimes caused
    ToonTalk to crash after using Dusty.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/3</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dealing with notebooks inside of notebooks
    that were created in an earlier version of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem with control-F8 (which
    releases the mouse).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/4</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes parts of pictures or pictures
    visible in a notebook were running prematurely.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk now deals better with losing or obtaining the focus
    when ToonTalk is running in a window.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with large fractions that are displayed as
    exact decimals when the fraction format is significantly shorter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of the window when switching
    from full-screen to windowed mode.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/6</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying some fractions of very large
    integers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem where in the puzzle game
    you can move your hand and arm too off screen or off the top.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the implementation of the new
    toontalk.ini extension option MissingBuiltinPictureFileExtensionIf8Bit.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/8</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying HTML dialogs while ToonTalk is
    initializing (e.g. to report some missing files).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of text pads if typed to
    immediately after picking the pad out of Tooly the Toolbox.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying text and number pads that are over
    32K long (about 30 screens) on Windows 95/98/Me where text was displayed after the right
    edge.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem displaying very wide text and number pads on
    Windows 95/98/Me where the background became transparent.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 35g released. (Don't worry about b through f.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta36"><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/11</font> </a>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem using the -puzzle command line option where
    ToonTalk would still ask if you wanted to run puzzles, demos, or free play.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem when ToonTalk tried to display a message box
    with more than 1024 characters of text inside.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If running ToonTalk with the mouse cursor visible sometimes
    it wasn't restored after pausing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Updated the code that copies files needed for running Java
    applets to fit into the new Windows XP guidelines.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/12</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with converting Japanese text pads to Java
    applets where about half the text was cut off.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/13</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Box labels created with Japanese text can now display
    correctly when brought into a non-Japanese version of ToonTalk. (A proper font and a
    Unicode page code are also needed to see Japanese text when ToonTalk is not running in a
    Japanese version of Windows.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some implementations of Java (e.g. Sun's 1.1.8) do not work
    correctly with Japanese text, so in Java applets ToonTalk sensors are computed in English
    (e.g. &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;) even if running in the Japanese version of
    ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed an occasional problem with the selection region of
    Dusty the Vacuum.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made some improvements in how ToonTalk internally handles
    window size changes. Includes some cases of minimizing and maximizing.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/15</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the reliability of  descriptions of some kinds of
    new numbers. Used when Marty describes things and on the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture was saved in a notebook while running, then it
    started running as soon as you started to take it out. It now waits until it is full size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you copied a picture that was running using the Magic
    Wand, then the copy would sometimes start running too soon.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes putting a picture on the clipboard while it was
    running and then pasting it made only parts of the picture run. (Turning the picture off
    and then on fixed the problem.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 3/29 where if the bottom or
    right edge of a picture was exactly at the edge of the window internal errors happened
    (but typically were internally repaired).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk stopped reading the mouse
    coordinates.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/16</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes robots on the back of

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a DirectDraw problem that sometimes occurred when
    quitting ToonTalk.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/17</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where pictures on top of a picture stored in
    a notebook started moving when the notebook was opened to the page.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where interrupting a demo while on the floor
    holding something caused a Java applet to be generated.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/18</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of short box labels.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed the warning that Marty gives when dropping a flipped
    picture on a unflipped picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where stopped or erased numerical sensors
    forgot their current value when saved and restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where vacuuming up pictures moving on top of
    other pictures and then restoring them changed the shape of some pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes pictures didn't display their
    rightmost column or bottommost row of pixels.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/19</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where cities with notebooks that had been
    saved in an older file format didn't save correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that sometimes followed from vacuuming up a
    picture and its notebook of sensors.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a bird came from the back of a
    picture that had been turned off then the bird didn't behave correctly (it usually got
    stuck flying back).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem for users named &quot;temp&quot; when saving
    cities.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where numbers were sometimes the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes sensors were being updated when on the back of a
    picture that had been turned off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When ToonTalk encounters a notebook saved in an older version
    of the file format, it updates it. It now stores the update so this is only done the first
    time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In some cases loading a robot whose thought bubble has
    sensors in it made those sensors active.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the appearance of a robot after his name was
    completely rubbed out (or a text pad was rubbed out and was in the &quot;See Some&quot;
    visibility mode).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem if the &quot;-puzzle&quot; command line
    option is used and the name of the file is quoted (maybe because it contains spaces).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/23</font>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating a description of some joystick
    sensors (e.g. when Marty describes them or they are put on the clipboard).</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/24</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot is given a serial number that is unique to that
    installation of ToonTalk. If two robots from different computers have the same serial
    number then if they were both part of the same Java applet it didn't work right.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sensors on the back of pictures with textual values when
    copied wasted a significant amount of time figuring what size they would like to be (but
    then are put in a box anyway).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Found and fixed a performance bug in the way sensors whose
    value is 'yes' or 'no' work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the '<a href="command.htm#ScreenWidth">-screen_width</a>'
    command line switch so ToonTalk can now run in any full-screen mode whose ratio is 4 to 3.
    (Previously the maximum resolution was 1600x1200.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7/31</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a performance bug when long-distance birds are given

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the handling of Dusty being run in reverse while he
    hasn't finished sucking up the last thing.</font></li>

    set some values back to their default state.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that occurred when you tried to rub out a sensor
    showing a textual value.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Typing '-' and '+' switch the state of sensors with textual
    values to the previous or next value. Now rubout works the same as '-' to go back to the
    lesser value.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented new customization options <a
    href="ttini.htm#DustyUsedOncePerClick">DustyUsedOncePerClick</a> and <a

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/22</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in the handling of the remote control for whether
    sound effects are enabled or not.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the internal workings of notebooks. It should be
    faster to use and flip through them but they sometimes might take more time to load
    initially.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/29</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where visiting a city with mouse speed
    sensors on the floor caused a bug.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the mouse speed sensors were acting as

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">8/30</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a robot trained to use the vacuum in
    reverse didn't work right if it was trained with the new <a
    href="ttini.htm#DustyUsedOncePerClick">DustyUsedOncePerClick</a> feature enabled.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Implemented the new <a href="ttini.htm#SaveInXML">SaveInXML</a>
    option. Currently it works for saving to the clipboard or notebook but not for saving
    entire cities (to come soon).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beta 36 (and 2.54) released.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Beta37"><font face="Comic Sans MS">9/6</font> </a>

<ol>

    the thought bubble of a robot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A robot can now be trained to drop a box on a robot that is
    already on the back of a picture.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">20/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where a robot successfully matches some sensors
    and then finds a mismatch in some subsequent constants and the robot then waited for the
    sensors to change (which obviously won't help). Such robots now fail.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If something in a thought bubble is red due to a mismatch it
    now returns to normal when vacuumed.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">21/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused some sensors to display the wrong
    value while in the notebook. And the value didn't change as it should.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mismatches with something in a robot's thought bubble now
    glows red (so it isn't confused with a different data type).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When a robot was trained to remove something from the back of
    a picture it remembers the type of the item and when run later removes something of the
    same type. This didn't work right if it was trained to find a number or text pad and there
    was a number or text pad that had ever been flipped over.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">22/9</font>

    in puzzles were displayed without the background number pad.</font></li>

    ToonTalk now reverts to the older dialogs.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">24/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced two new toontalk.ini options for controlling the
    HTML page that is generated when generating a Java applet. They are <a
    href="ttini.htm#JavaSourceHTML">JavaSourceHTML and ToonTalkSourceHTML</a> and are found in
    the Java section of toontalk.ini.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalkSourceHTML is used then the source for the
    ToonTalk object held is also saved in the Java directory so that the page can link to the
    object.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduced the toontalk.ini option <a
    href="ttini.htm#SpeakToolButtons">SpeakToolButtons</a> so that when the button on a tool
    is changed you hear what the new mode is.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">26/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sound of tools no longer repeats if options are used to
    make them work once per click.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems using tools by holding down the right mouse
    button to keep them on when customized to work once per click.</font></li>

    without problem.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">30/9</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the right mouse button is enabled then it will now turn
    off tools as well as turn them on. Thanks to Gordon for suggesting this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/1</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem matching erased remote controls for the looks
    of a picture in a thought bubble. Thanks to Ylva for reporting an example of this.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem replaying demos that used
    the clipboard.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that prevented F11 from undoing Bammer if a bird
    was in a thought bubble in the thing being bammed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Under unusual circumstances you could set off a bomb and get
    out of the house and it didn't explode but errors occurred when re-entering the house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug in blowing up decorated houses.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs using F11 to undo Bammer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a nest was on the back of a picture without its bird and
    something was added to the picture then a spurious copy of the nest was made. Thanks to
    Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">For various reasons ToonTalk no longer attempts to undo
    Bammer if a robot did the dropping (either while being trained or while repeating its
    training).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Previously you couldn't use F11 to undo Bammer of something
    that was running (e.g. robots were active on the back).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that sometimes occurred when saving large
    negative numbers in a notebook or the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where sometimes clipped or off the side parts

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a copy of a nest with long-distance
    birds where it lost its connection to birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Plugged a memory leak related to using F11 to undo Bammer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know here an appropriate sound when pressing F11 and
    ToonTalk can't undo the last action of Bammer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving robots that picked something up from a
    stack and returned it if saved in the new XML format.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk cannot find the language-specific library (DLL)
    then it tries to use the US English version if available. This is particularly important
    for people with non-English versions of ToonTalk that try new beta versions.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/5</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk once again looks first at the old location for Java
    media files (images and sounds) before searching for them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems with the installer updating or creating
    toontalk.ini in the ToonTalk subdirectory of the My Documents folder.</font></li>

    occurred when running ToonTalk with only 256 colors.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/14</font>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the meaning of <a href="ttini.htm#SpeakToolButtons">SpeakToolButtons</a>

    Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a performance problem the first time Bammer smashes

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/16</font> 

<ol>

    pictures was wrong when saved in XML. (Often the geometry was too off that the parts were
    off the edge.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The HTML dialog options are now able to accept short file
    names and then default to where the manual pages are. E.g. ToonTalk\Doc\English. This
    makes it easier to have the same installation switch languages.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The old demos are currently run by old versions of ToonTalk
    that use an old version of toontalk.ini. The old version is kept up-to-date now if changed

    speaking interfered with the code that keeps Marty moving out of your way.</font></li>

</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/21</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed the implementation of notebooks so they now load much
    faster and consume much less memory. Page flipping the first time through a notebook may
    sometimes be a bit slower.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sometimes a picture gets the size it had
    when it was flipped over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where the size of a picture isn't right if a

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/24</font>

    removed sensors from a picture's sensor notebook the sensors weren't connected properly.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug that caused cities saved with

    restored (in XML) so that they now only need to be loaded when first viewed not when
    ToonTalk starts up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.61.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/31</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Removed the &quot;feature&quot; that renamed a robot 
  after retraining.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If ToonTalk doesn't recognize an XML element 
  when something is loaded into ToonTalk it is retained so if that object is 
  later saved the extra XML is part of the XML format. This means that many 
  features from newer versions of ToonTalk aren't lost as something is loaded 
  and then saved in an older version of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Began implementing saving cities in XML.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/1</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now save Dusty, Pumpy, and Maggie in XML 
  format.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the saving of notebooks in XML.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can now save Tooly in XML.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pictures are considered the same (for purposes 
  such as returning them to the stack) if they only differ in geometry. This was 
  extended so if they are considered equal if the only other difference is that 
  they have position or size sensors on the back that are displaying different 
  values. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with the size of a picture when 
  taken out of a box if it had been saved in XML format and then loaded.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/6</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot matches a blank picture against a 
  picture with robots running on the back then it would only run once per frame 
  even if no other sensors were involved.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/8</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with how ToonTalk's internal 
  cache was only partially flushed sometimes when you left ToonTalk and then 
  returned (e.g. clicking 'Come Back Later'); This can cause crashes sometimes 
  soon after resuming ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you flipped a number over twice and dropped 
  a number on its remote control for its looks and then picked up the number 
  underneath before Bammer comes then sometimes the number is both in your hand 
  and on the floor and chaos could follow.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the geometry of text and number pads 
  that were flipped twice and then typed to.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the Puzzle Game if you brought back a box 
  with one hole but the wrong contents then Marty gave you inappropriate advice 
  about the order of things in the box being wrong. Thanks to Lennart for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you put something on the clipboard and then 
  generated a demo that pasted it into ToonTalk, it sometimes did not replay 
  correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Log files are no longer limited to recording 
  pasting of things less than 64K bytes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot tries to pick up something that is 
  missing sometimes ToonTalk crashed. You now get a nice warning from Marty. 
  Thanks to Augusto for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/12</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduce problem where if you 
  sat while Marty was displaying a talk balloon the balloon can get very large. 
  Thanks to Ylva for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/13 </font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Major overhaul in the internal workings of how 
  built-in objects animate and how robots when animating know when to do the 
  next operation. Needed for saving cities in XML.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/15</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if a bird is heading back to where he

  crashed. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/18</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Copies of built-in notebooks were saved in 
  wasteful manner. No longer.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/20</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that was sometimes caused by 
  blowing up a house with decoration on the front.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/21</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced with version 2.61 
  where user sounds sounded like static.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/22</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to take a picture off

  had been flipped twice instead.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/23</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made small improvements to the internal 
  workings of sound effects.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/25</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a mysterious bug that caused crashes on a 
  small fraction of test machines. Was triggered by displaying an image that was 
  clipped (partially off screen). Thanks to Jakob for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.62</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/26</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduce bug where some 
  animations looked bad - e.g. Dusty sucking something up. Thanks to Jakob for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The XML of saved ToonTalk objects has extra 
  descriptive information only when they are saved to the clipboard. Those saved 
  in cities or notebooks are more compact.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">11/27</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating Java applets when 
  different robots did exactly the same thing. Thanks to Ylva for reporting 
  this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem when a 
  robot drops a box on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you train a robot to use keyboard 
  shortcuts for tools like Dusty or the Magic Wand, then they are converted to 
  equivalent keystrokes that are language neutral. This did not work right when 
  a keyboard shortcut was used to leave the tool's state unchanged but to turn 
  it on. (E.g. typing 's' when S is already showing.) Such robots may not work 
  when imported to a different language version of ToonTalk. Fixed now but old 
  robots may still have this shortcoming.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.63</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced bug where a robot 
  got stuck sometimes giving things to birds. Thanks to Yishay for reporting 
  this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem saving a city in XML with an 
  empty notebook on the floor. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Due to the difficulty of picking up entire 
  flipped picture if there is 1, 4, 9, etc. objects on the back when the number 
  of items is the square of an integer the spacing between items is doubled. 
  Thanks to Ylva for pointing out this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with saving boxes in thought 
  bubbles in XML format. Thanks to Gordon and Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where if a robot removed things 
  from a nest then sometimes &quot;ghosts&quot; of those items appeared. Thanks to Gordon 
  for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped something on a bird and then 
  quickly dropped something else then only one thing is delivered and the other 
  is stuck to the bird. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem loading cities with built-in 
  pictures on the floor. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating demos when SaveInXML 
  is on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 10/29 where

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk sometimes 
  crashed when you picked up a robot that was part of a team.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem converting number pads to text 
  pads when the robot isn't being watched. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem double clicking on a ToonTalk 
  file (e.g. CTY or TT) that had a dash '-'in its name. Thanks to Lennart for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added a new entry to the Switch section of 
  toontalk.ini - OKToCreateVeryLargeCrashReports. If set to 1 then crash dumps 
  can become very large and take a while to create. Recommended only for serious 
  ToonTalk users particularly if a bug is interfering with your work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.64</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced last month where 
  sometimes a robot waits forever after giving a bird something to deliver. 
  Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when a robot is done he vacuums up 
  something that isn't there (no harm done but you see him take out a copy of 
  Dusty and hear him turn it on when there is nothing to suck up).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced last month where 
  ToonTalk sometimes crashes after setting off a bomb.</font></li>

  sometimes after a robot finishes, another robot in the team doesn't go ahead

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released 2.65</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem introduced on 10/18 where 
  sometimes ToonTalk crashes if nests with long-distance birds are loaded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed recently introduced problems saving a 
  city in XML format while a bird is flying.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems dropping a number operation 
  that had been flipped and flipped back on top of another number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem caused by number operations 
  dropped on operations. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where a picture dropped on 
  another picture becomes &quot;SEE SOME&quot; instantly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where pasting the same thing 
  containing nests that was stored in XML more than one time caused the nests to 
  become linked. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A long-distance bird in a thought bubble no 
  longer saves in XML as long-distance but as an ordinary bird instead.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a foreign bird was given a box with nests 
  where there should be birds, ToonTalk sometimes crashed. Now Marty gives you a 
  nice explanation. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk running in full-screen mode crashed if 
  you typed control-alt-delete. Thanks to Yishay for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you drop a text pad on a picture then it 
  becomes &quot;SEE SOME&quot;. If you then press F11 to &quot;unbam&quot; them the text pad 
  remained &quot;SEE SOME&quot;. No longer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes if you took a number with lots of 
  digits out of a box it expanded to a good size and then abruptly shrank to a 
  narrow size. Fixed now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem using fractions on remote 
  controls where the remote control briefly got an incorrect value.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem with remote controls displaying 
  negative numbers when a non-integer was added. Round-off error made the result 
  1 or 2 units too small.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a picture with parts was placed in a very 
  small object (e.g. a small box or notebook) then when saved and restored the 
  geometry was only roughly restored. The round-off error was apparent. Such 
  pictures saved in 2.66 and later using the XML format will restore accurately. 
  Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/11</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various bugs with robots using foreign

  F11 is pressed after Bammer bams.</font></li>

  the address when the avenue or street sensor was inactive and saved and 
  restored. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a minor memory leak that occurred when 
  you changed the value of a street or avenue sensor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem creating 
  demos while running with SaveInXML on.</font></li>

  temporarily removed things from her nest. XML format only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed some problems saving a city with the 
  power off while robots were running. XML format only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem generating demos that start in 
  a saved city while XML format is enabled.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made many improvements to how boxes are saved 
  if they are being used (e.g. something is dropping into a hole) while a city 
  is saved (in XML format).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem unbamming (via F11) the drop of 
  something on the remote control for the looks of something else.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A number on the floor that has robots on the 
  back that are changing the number of digits would drift to the side of the 
  screen. No longer. Similar problem with text pads fixed as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where numbers inside of boxes 
  that have robots on the back changing their value would sometimes stop 
  updating their display. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you held something over a flipped picture 
  with items on the back then the feedback as to whether some item on the back 
  wiggles (e.g. dropping a box on a robot) or the whole picture wiggles was 
  inaccurate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem dropping a box on a robot on 
  remote control for the looks of the back of a picture where it wasn't attached 
  to the robot. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If some copies of the same remote control were 
  active and others inactive and one the inactive ones had its values changed 
  (e.g. by typing to it) then the other copies of the remote control changed. 
  This caused some crashes using remote controls for the address. Thanks to 
  Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where dropping things into 
  trucks was abrupt (animation wasn't displayed).</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/13</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you save a city in XML after Bammer has 
  smashed something it is now possible in the restored city to press F11 to 
  unbam things.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where abrupt actions happened 
  on the first cycle after loading a city saved in XML. They now continue as if 
  they had never been saved and restored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where some sensors that display 
  pictures when placed in a box were somewhat too small. They now fill the box 
  hole as much as possible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you make your hand invisible and then stand 
  up you now become visible. Thanks to Gordon for initiating a discussion of 
  this on toontalk@yahoogroups.com.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Simplified the internal state of robots so they 
  are somewhat smaller and use a little less memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made many changes so that saving cities in XML 
  while robots are running works better.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug introduced on 7/16 where if you 
  took something from a notebook, vacuumed it up, and then took a fresh copy 
  from the notebook that sometimes ToonTalk thought the new copy was also inside 
  the vacuum. Robots in particular stopped. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/15</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way Marty described a robot that 
  stopped working due to some abnormal condition.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Restored the ability to get Marty to describe 
  why a robot stopped long after it has stopped. (E.g. when you walk into a 
  house with a robot that stopped, you can press F1 while pointing to the 
  robot.)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/16</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a robot was trained to drop a nest with an 
  egg in it on the ground and then pick up the nest or bird, then when running 
  he would pick up the object before the hatching animation displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">The position sensors for pictures once again 
  display integers. Also if you drop something on them that forces them to 
  become non-integers (like 1/2) then they will remain non-integers until moved 
  or subsequent operations make them integers again. Thanks to Gordon for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Remote controls that display other values when 
  erased displayed like an erased picture. Now they display appropriately (e.g. 
  the parts sensor displays as an erased box).&nbsp; Thanks to Gordon for 
  reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way built-in notebooks save in 
  XML.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that caused a crash when 
  loading a city saved in XML when the main notebook had been extended when 
  generating a demo file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the &quot;Picture Number&quot; sensor for 
  synthetic pictures (e.g. lines, circles, and the like at the end of the 
  Pictures notebook), displayed values above 255.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed problems with rounding off the position 
  sensors of a picture - especially serious when adding a number less than one 
  to a negative sensor.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/17</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed various problems restoring a city saved 
  while a robot was working on the floor. XML format only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem that occurred when you dropped 
  a picture with robots on the back that destroyed the picture on another 
  picture. Thanks to Leonel for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have an invisible picture with visible 
  pictures on top, then if you tried to use the Magic Wand or Dusty on it, it 
  would disappear until you moved the tools away.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a performance bug when invisible pictures 
  are on the floor.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/18</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle involving long-distance birds was 
  solved, then when the same user name later ran Free Play, ToonTalk would try 
  to establish net connections for the long-distance bird of the puzzle. Thanks 
  to Lennart for providing an example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a puzzle included Tooly, Dusty, Pumpy, or 
  Maggie was solved, then when the same user is later running Free Play those 
  tools may be missing or altered. Thanks to Lennart for providing an example of 
  this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the root of integer was between 1 and 2 
  then it was rounded down to 1. So, for example, the square root of 2 (and 3) 
  was 1, and the cube root of 7 was too. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this. 
  The fix for this involved using a more up-to-date version of the GMP library 
  which should be faster and have other bug fixes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash report email now includes the ToonTalk 
  version number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Released to 2.67</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/19</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">ToonTalk no longer crashes if a picture is 
  destroyed (e.g. a robot on the back sets off a bomb) after it is dropped on 
  another picture but before it is smashed by Bammer. Also fixed a similar bug 
  if the picture underneath self-destructs. Thanks to Leonel for providing an 
  example of this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way numbers are saved in XML 
  format.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you vacuumed a picture from the remote looks 
  of another picture while the original picture was flipped over ToonTalk 
  crashed. Thanks to Leonel for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a problem where MaximumItemsInDusty was 
  ignored if set to 1. Thanks to Gordon for reporting this.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way cities are saved while trucks 
  are driving outside. XML format only.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/20</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the way cities are saved when a bird 
  and her nest are saved or when a picture and its sensor are saved together. 
  XML format only.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/26</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Improved the ways cities are saved in XML if 
  things were left on the ground outside.</font></li>

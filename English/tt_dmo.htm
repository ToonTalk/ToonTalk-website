<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>How to Create Your Own Demos 
using Time Travel</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i>Advanced users:</i></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To create a demo using time travel just run 
ToonTalk with time travel on. This will
create a file named time_travel.DMO in the user's folder in the ToonTalk folder 
in My Documents. The &quot;dmo&quot; file records everything you do (every mouse movement, 
keyboard click, etc.) Double clicking on the file will start up the demo. You 
will probably want to copy and rename it. time_travel.DMO can be inspected or 
altered by unzipping it with any unzip program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If your demo includes pictures or sounds that you 
have imported into ToonTalk, they set the
						<span lang="en-gb">
<a href="ttini.htm#IncludeMediaInTimeTravelArchives">IncludeMediaInTimeTravelArchives</a> 
option to 1 before creating your demo.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding subtitles to your demos</b>. When ToonTalk starts
running a time travel demo named X it looks for a file named X.ust inside the 
time_travel.DMO archive. (&quot;ust&quot; is the default
extension name for American English subtitles - in general the extension is the two-letter
country code followed by 't'.) You can override the default for your computer by providing
an &quot;SubtitlesSuffix&quot; entry in the &quot;FileExtensions&quot; section of the
ToonTalk.ini file in your Windows directory. A subtitle file is made of entries separated
by a blank line. Each entry has the time in milliseconds since the beginning of the demo
followed by the text of the subtitle. It is recommended that any lines of text more than
60 characters be broken. The &quot;demos&quot; subdirectory of your ToonTalk installation
has many sample subtitle files. One way to obtain the millisecond timings is to press F9
while the demo is playing back. This will record the time in your &lt;user name&gt;.txt log
file in the &quot;users&quot; subdirectory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Adding narration to your demos</b>. When ToonTalk starts
running a time travel demo named X it looks for a file named X.spkinside the 
time_travel.DMO archive. (&quot;spk&quot; is the default
extension name for American English narration files - in general the extension is the
two-letter country code followed by 'n'.) You can override the default for your computer
by providing an &quot;SubtitlesSuffix&quot; entry in the &quot;FileExtensions&quot;
section of the ToonTalk.ini file in your Windows directory. To create a narration file you
should record segments of the narration (256 is the maximum number) and name them
&quot;s01.wav&quot;, &quot;s02.wav&quot; and so on. These files should be placed on the
main ToonTalk directory while generating the narration file. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To create the narration file (in the &quot;Demos&quot;
subdirectory) add '-create_narration 1' or '-create_narration 2' to the command line.
&nbsp; A value of 1 changes the meaning of F11 to mean start the next narration segment
(the next s&lt;nn&gt;.wav file). A value of 2 means use the start times from the subtitle
file. If you want to specify the times when the narration should start but don't want
subtitles, then create a temporary subtitle file (where the lines of text could be
anything (e.g. &quot;X&quot;) and only the start times are important. You can use
'-create_narration' together with '-o' or '-I' depending upon whether you want to create
the demo and narration at the same time, or to add narration to an existing demo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Coordinating the subtitles and narration</b>. If you wish
to create both narration and subtitles, you can create the subtitles first and use
'-create_narration 2' or else you can create the narration first and then run your demo
with &quot;-print_narration_start_times 1&quot; which will print the start times of each
segment in your &lt;<i>user name</i>&gt;.log in the &quot;Users&quot; subdirectory. You
can then use these times while creating your subtitles file. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Tips:</b></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A demo file works for the same resolution as it was recorded.
    With luck you can record a high-resolution demo and copy it to the low resolution
    subdirectory and it will work. See the subdirectories of &quot;Demos&quot; 
  in the ToonTalk installation directory for examples. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Avoid using keyboard accelerators for tools (e.g. 'e' to make
    Dusty erase things). These accelerators differ from language to language so if you use
    them your demos probably won't work in a different language version of ToonTalk. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you are creating a demo on a fast computer and expect the
    demo to be run on slower machines then it is recommended that you add <a
    href="command.htm#FrameDurationMinimum">-y 50</a> (or a similar number) to the command
    line while recording to slow down your machine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can create a video or animation of a demo by creating
    series of <a href="scrnshot.htm">screen snapshots</a>.</font></li>

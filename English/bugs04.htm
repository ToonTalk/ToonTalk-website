</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">10/1</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a recently introduced problem replaying

  file. The replay_logs.zip file is no longer created.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12/1</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you dropped a nest on a notebook and left 
  the page open, then birds would try to deliver things to the nest despite the 
  fact it was in the notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that could lead to an infinite 
  recursion and use up available memory when saving an object containing a nest

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Undid a change introduced on 23/8/03 that 
  caused animations to finish instantly if the camera panned (or you scrolled if 
  you prefer that metaphor). This change fixed a problem where the geometry of 
  actions came out wrong if panning happened while animating. The geometry is 
  now correct so no need to finish instantly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a bird on the floor is given something she

  <a href="ttini.htm#DontScrollOnFloor">DontScrollOnFloor </a>that makes the 
  floor the same size as the screen so scrolling or panning is disabled. This is 
  the way the puzzle game works - now it is an option in Free Play.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes when replaying a time travel log the 
  size of Marty's talk balloons were wrong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug where sometimes during time travel 
  some objects animate strangely. For example, if you are holding Dusty

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tooly would sometimes get into a slightly

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fixed a bug that broke puzzle 44 (only if 
  puzzle 43 was done - not if you jumped to puzzle 44). Generally any puzzles 
  following a puzzle that required a covered nest as a solution could trigger 
  this.</font></li>

  travel replay at segment boundaries.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">After you save something to a file, you now see 
  a new dialog screen. It offers to show you the directory where your file was 
  saved. Furthermore, the file is now created in a subdirectory called Programs 
  of your user directory.</font></li>
  <li></font><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">Released 3.46X.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/2</font></p>
<ol>

  media file names from different pages of the same notebook to determine what 
  media files the entire notebook requires.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Since 3/2 the default value for the

  DontScrollOnFloor</a> was set to 1.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk no longer leaves temporary 
  copies of the snapshot when saving something to a file. The snapshot file is 
  still inside the TT file and can be extracted by any unzip utility.</font></li>
</ol>

  deal with the drag and drop of files into ToonTalk.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The
  <a href="sensor.htm#Milliseconds since Last Frame">milliseconds since last 
  cycle sensor</a> in demos and time travel now works correctly if you pause 
  ToonTalk and resume it after more than 65 seconds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the accuracy of the relative 
  time display when replaying someone else's time travel logs.</font></li>

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">14/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When external files are imported into 
  ToonTalk (e.g. by drag and drop) then a copy of the files is kept inside the 
  time travel logs so they can be replayed even if that imported file no longer 
  exists or is on another computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem if time travel 
  recording was paused and then jumped to a different segment and play was 
  pressed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem (and unfortunately 
  introduced a bug that was fixed 19/3) that occurred when adding to the end of 
  a time travel archive.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">15/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk now recovers better from 
  errors while replaying demos or time travel logs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When a time travel demo has been 
  replayed to the end you now the time travel buttons so you can add to the end, 
  replay, or quit. Previously it just started adding to the end.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demos now include a copy of the 
  initial state of the main notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a time travel bug that occurred

  ToonTalk wouldn't start because it thought ToonTalk was already running.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug that could cause errors 
  while ToonTalk is exiting.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug creating a new time line 
  while time travelling (recording while &quot;in the past&quot;). The change also means

  whether it would be ignored or cause confusion).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a time travel bug caused by 
  jumping to a segment where Marty is talking.</font></li>

  caused by jumping to a segment where a bird is flying.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">17/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem using the
  <a href="command.htm#OutputLog">-o</a> command line option to explicitly name 
  the newly created demo file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demos created with </font><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">the <a href="command.htm#OutputLog">-o</a> 
  command line option by default now end up in the Demos subfolder of the user's 
  ToonTalk folder.</font></big></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where a robot didn't work 
  correctly if trained to use the magic wand to copy something from a notebook 
  page (rather than just pick up an automatically generated copy).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem replaying a demo where 
  a user sound file was pasted into ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the handling of keyboard 
  events to infinite stacks (e.g. in Tooly). Further improved on 24/3.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Generalized the way sounds respond to 
  keyboard events to act like text pads. In particular you can now edit a 
  text-to-speech sound by typing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where ToonTalk forgot 
  the original name of an imported sound file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the handling of sound files

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">19/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the accuracy of the timing of

  enough to cause subtitles or narration to get out of synch.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug when dividing an integer 
  that was internally represented with more than 32 bits when divided by a 32 
  bit integer produced 0 as the result.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">20/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug restoring a city that had 
  been saved with the power off. Also affected time travel when power was off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling if running

  been paused while recording.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the display of a number in a 
  box that had been flipped over and restored when rubout is typed to it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the display of a number if 
  its remote looks is typed to.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Since it can take quite a while to 
  create a new time line by recording somewhere in the middle of time archive, 
  the cursor now turns into an hourglass.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If something goes wrong while 
  replaying a time travel segment ToonTalk skips to the next segment. It now 
  also plays a &quot;plop&quot; sound to signal the replay isn't proceeding flawlessly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If while recording time travel you 
  click on Pause twice you get a dialog screen. Returning from that dialog 
  screen used to return you to recording but now you return to the time travel 
  interface so you can choose to do other things than continue recording.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the response if replaying a 
  time travel log and a button other than the pause button is clicked.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">22/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot loads a truck and the city 
  is full, the robot used to stop and Marty reported the problem. The truck now 
  drives off and searches for a lot to become empty.</font></li>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed another problem replaying 
  narrated or subtitled demos where ToonTalk was paused during the recording.</font></big></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">24/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a memory leak related to pages 
  in a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sped up the time to exit from 
  ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem keeping track of user 
  media files in notebooks where pages contain multiple user media files.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">25/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem in non-English 
  versions of copying and pasting the mathematical operations that require more 
  than one character (e.g. &quot;sine&quot; and &quot;denominator&quot;).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where sensors that 
  display words (e.g. &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;) lost track of which natural language to 
  use sometimes if added to a notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that caused Marty to 
  say &quot;last key pressedIf you pick&quot; without a space between &quot;pressed&quot; and &quot;if&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes spurious warnings about 
  something being destroyed twice were caused by destroying a picture when its 
  notebook of remote controls was on the floor.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">26/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug caused by training a robot

  robot with a box containing </font></big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">a 
  bird and her nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The feedback you get when holding 
  something over something else often did not correspond to what happened if the 
  item was dropped. Now they should always be identical.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The remote looks of a picture when in 
  the thought bubble of a robot is converted to an ordinary picture. This didn't 
  happen if you sucked the box out of a robot's thought bubble and put a remote 
  control for the looks of a picture in the box and put the box back in the 
  thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a major memory leak that 
  occurred on computers with too little memory to hold all the graphical objects 
  (less than 256MB with a moderate screen resolution). Also pausing and resuming 
  many times in the same session caused this. And importing a very large picture 
  (several MB) caused this. Another part of this leak was fixed on 28/2.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If an erased user picture is imported 
  to another computer where the saved the media files are not available and 
  hadn't been saved with the object, then it became an erased text pad.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">27/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Implemented a new toontalk.ini Switch
  <a href="ttini.htm#SaveMediaInMainNotebook">SaveMediaInMainNotebook</a> that 
  should be used if a user (or a default user) is to be moved to another 
  computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Eliminated spurious warnings if a tool 
  is dropped on an erased notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a notebook is open to page with a 
  picture with sensors on the back and the notebook is copied and one copy is 
  vacuumed up then sometimes the sensors became blank.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">28/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demos where more than 64K events 
  happen within one cycle (probably has yet to happen) will now replay 
  correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The format of demos was changed for 
  robustness and so that errors can be recovered from. Note this means that 
  demos created with 3.55 or later are not likely to run correctly in older 
  versions of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When replaying a demo or time travel 
  of the dragging or pasting of multiple files into ToonTalk the resulting box 
  was not the right size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Eliminated some problems in time 
  travel related to changes in the main notebook.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when text pads have been 
  placed on a decoration sensor (wall, roof, or house) it switched back from See 
  Some to See All so the background pad became visible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where sometimes the 
  decoration sensors didn't fit in a box hole correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes the roof or house decoration 
  wasn't updated correctly and multiple copies of decoration appeared on top. 
  And the placement of the copies was not correct.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where notebooks 
  containing user media that were placed in the main notebook lost track of 
  media files needed for export.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the geometry of text pads 
  that are picked up from Tooly and immediately typed to (before they have 
  become a good size).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed another part of the leak 
  discovered on 26/2.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with saving and 
  restoring a picture that is missing its file.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">29/2</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when rerecording during time 
  travel the first new segment lasted too long.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the time travel archive is missing 
  the most recent version of the city (due to a crash or abnormal exit), 
  ToonTalk now starts with the most recent log segment.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a city was saved or a time travel 
  segment ended while houses were exploding then on replay the houses didn't 
  explode properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the drop feedback on boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug processing </font><big><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">the <a href="command.htm#OutputLog">-o</a> 
  command line option if the file name is quoted (typically because it contains 
  spaces).</font></big></big></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug processing </font><big><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">the <a href="command.htm#OutputLog">-o</a> 
  command line option if the file name is </font></big></big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ended with DMO.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Numbers sometimes displayed drop 
   feedback when something is held over them that can't be dropped on a number.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sensors that expect text pads to be 
   dropped on them now give drop feedback only if a text pad is held over them.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved drop feedback for notebooks.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now return an empty notebook 
   back to a stack (e.g. the stack of empty notebooks in the main notebook).</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Made additional drop feedback 
   improvements.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug that was triggered by 
   landing on the water. This can be done by almost landing and then moving the 
   helicopter to towards the water.</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you suck a box out of a robot's 
   thought bubble then you can either put a box back (typically after editing 
   the box that was sucked out) or give it the robot for retraining. The drop 
   feedback now indicates which will happen (depending upon whether the box is 
   held over the robot or thought bubble).</font></li>
   <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes while exiting ToonTalk 
   after running in full-screen mode, a dialog appeared but it was underneath 
   the current window.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a recently introduced bug that 
  sometimes prevented dropping a box on a robot on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug creating a new branch of 
  the current time line.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug generating unique internal 
  file names.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">2/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Replaced the 3.1 version of the 
  multiple precision arithmetic package (GMP) with the 4.1 version. Is reported 
  to be more robust and a workaround to a division bug that doubled the cost of 
  division is no longer used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Changed the default value of the 
  toontalk.ini Switch <a href="ttini.htm#MovementSelectionFeedback">
  MovementSelectionFeedback</a> from 1 to 2 pixels since this makes the wiggle 
  feedback easier to notice.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The <a href="command.htm#InputLog">-I 
  command line option</a> now accepts relative file paths. E.g. UK\intro_v2 to 
  indicate the intro_v2.dmo file in the UK subfolder of the ToonTalk Demos 
  folder.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Implemented a new toontalk.ini Switch
  <a href="ttini.htm#MakeCurrentExeDefault">MakeCurrentExeDefault</a> so that 
  you can more easily update which version of ToonTalk should be the default 
  version.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">3/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the wording of the DLL 
  foreign bird warning and now support different language versions of the 
  warning.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a demo or time travel archive 
  contains a ToonTalk executable (a version guaranteed to be able to run the 
  demo), then you are now asked if you want to run it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Implemented a new toontalk.ini 
  Executables option <a href="ttini.htm#UseThisIniFileFirst">UseThisIniFileFirst</a>. 
  This is useful for administering networked installations on multiple 
  computers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Implemented a new toontalk.ini

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where Marty would 
  speak nonsense when describing a robot that did something after setting of a 
  bomb (not clear how such a robot was trained). Fixed a bug in the 2/16 change &quot;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">A 
  running robot now always ignores things dropped on him&quot; that sometimes the 
  robot didn't ignore things.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The maximum length of a toontalk.ini entry was 
  doubled from 256 to 512 characters.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a long-distance bird is given 
  something and ToonTalk can't connect to the nest, it keeps trying. I used to 
  try once a second and now the frequency which it tries grows until it reaches 
  a maximum of one minute.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The XML produced when a ToonTalk 
  object is saved sometimes has additional information that is ignored by 
  ToonTalk but is helpful in understanding by a human reader. This extra 
  information is only added when something is placed on the clipboard to avoid 
  the overhead in other cases.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The text on a sound pad can now be 
  edited using the keyboard while it is held.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem caused by copying 
  (e.g. using control-c) followed by multiple pastes (e.g. using control-v) 
  where sometimes an part is shared between the two copies.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced on 18/2 that 
  broke the self-copying mode of the Magic Wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Made the DirectX graphics code more 
  robust in rare circumstances where it caused an error.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug in the code that deals

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed bugs introduced since 2.39 that 
  interfere with ToonTalk installations that fall back on the CD-ROM for files 
  not installed to the hard disk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the toontalk.ini file doesn't have 
  a setting for the Directories entry BuiltinPictureDir, a reasonable default is 
  used instead.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If an XML file is loaded where a 
  picture on top of a picture is missing geometry (seems there was a bug in 
  ToonTalk versions from about a year ago that created such files), then these 
  parts are now given a default size and location.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot can't find something he 
  expects he now looks confused and scratches his head.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem that occasionally 
  generated spurious warnings about something being a part of something else 
  when placed on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The -next_dialog </font><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">command line option now supports partial 
  file paths. (E.g. UK/dialog2.htm)</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk now recovers better from when

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The message &quot;If you insert the

  now in English if the CD-ROM is needed in order to access the 
  language-specific string table.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">HTML dialog files if not installed on 
  the hard drive can now be loaded from the ToonTalk CD-ROM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the toontalk.ini file doesn't have

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If ToonTalk can't find some necessary 
  internal files, it now checks the ToonTalk CD-ROM before quitting and 
  reporting the problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Warning dialog screens about the speed 
  of running off the CD-ROM and one advising that sound be turned on are no

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">14/3</font></p>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where if a notebook is 
  removed from the main notebook, changed, and then put on another page that it 
  sometimes loses the changes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduce a few weeks ago

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">16/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug resulting from copying a 
  bird who has no nest with the Magic Wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk thought 
  that successive pages in a notebook needed all the media files of the previous 
  pages. (Just wasteful.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug that where the size of 
  something on the page of a notebook that was copied was sometimes wrong.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">20/3</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a time travel replay bug that 
  sometimes caused problems replaying the first log segment.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a bird was given 
  something and her nest had been copied and some of the copies were no longer 
  available (e.g. on the wall of the rocket in the puzzle game) then one saw a 
  large number of copies of the bird delivering things. The fix should also 
  speed things up when the original nest has been vacuumed up or destroyed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced a few weeks ago 
  that caused the display of the relative time when replaying someone else's

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug in replaying a demo or a

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demos (and time travel) often don't

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Time travel archives were not 
  recording those <a href="ttini.htm">toontalk.ini options</a> that can affect 
  the accuracy of replay. This means that the replay may fail if ToonTalk is

  apply to non-time-travel demos. A work-around is to use the
  <a href="command.htm#LocalIniFile">-local_ini_file command line option</a>. 
  The options whose value can affect replay are

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The user's folder name (entered when 
  starting ToonTalk) is now limited to the first 100 characters in the user's

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Implemented the new toontalk.ini

  caused the tools to have a small size for new users (and no Default User 
  enabled). Bug is in 3.66 and 3.67 only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.68 and beta 42.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><a name="Beta43">14/4</a></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling with files 
  inside of demo and time travel archives.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">15/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added error handling in the case 
  DirectInput has troubles acquiring access to the mouse.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling while 
  using DirectDraw to show graphics.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where files were left 
  open causing problems saving and restoring in Windows 98 and Me.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Rather than report an error trying to 
  generate a crash report on Windows 98 and Me, ToonTalk no longer tries to 
  generate a crash dump for those versions of Windows.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk sometimes generated XML with 
  encoding instructions. This caused saving in Windows 98/Me to fail. A 
  consequence of this is that sometimes to view XML generated by ToonTalk in 
  Internet Explorer it needs to be saved as Unicode first. WordPad for example 
  can read in the XML and save it as Unicode.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem starting ToonTalk 
  while ToonTalk is already running that occurred only in Windows 98/Me.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">17/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Some redundant information in the XML 
  produced by ToonTalk was removed shrinking the files somewhat.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">20/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk under rare circumstances can 
  lose track of where a bird was supposed to return to and crash. Now the bird 
  just doesn't return.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the location of the display 
  of some objects when seen from the helicopter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem replaying demos 
  involving walking.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">21/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a time travel replay problem 
  involving colliding with the walls of the room while on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed many rare time travel replay 
  bugs that caused the replay to be inaccurate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk deals better now when 
  something is dropped on 2 items and one of them can't accept the item.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If something is changing size while 
  viewed from the helicopter it used to appear to drift away.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">While replaying a time travel log and 
  an error occurs ToonTalk didn't always jump to the next segment correctly.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">23/4</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">28/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem dropping a box on an 
  erased number (to obtain the number of holes).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with the clipboard 
  sensor when multiple items&nbsp; are pasted at once.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The clipboard sensor no longer 
  displays objects if a file is on the clipboard. When files are on the 
  clipboard and this sensor is active this was a major performance bug.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a PZL file was on the clipboard 
  then the copies of the initial items on the floor repeatedly appeared on the 
  floor when in Free Play.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">29/4</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes a bird delivered things to 
  its nest even though the nest was on a page of a notebook. No longer.</font></li>

  bird/nest pairs where sometimes the connection was not preserved when 
  reloaded.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem caused sometimes by 
  undoing Bammer's joining of boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demos and time travel archives 
  remember which media files were added to ToonTalk. The sound files are no 
  longer copied and kept in both temporarily storage and the media folder.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the way cities are saved and 
  restored so that Bammer can be undone in some circumstances.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when Bammer is undone after 
  combining numbers the result became for example &quot;+2&quot; rather than simply &quot;2&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When a sound file was pasted into 
  ToonTalk it had room for 32 characters regardless of whether the sound file 
  name was shorter or longer than that.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling while 
  ToonTalk is zipping files.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">3/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a bird is loaded or copied from a 
  thought bubble without a nest, it creates a new nest. If a city was saved 
  while it was creating a new nest or a time travel segment boundary occurred 
  then it did restore correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug caused by copying Tooly to 
  the clipboard and then pasting him in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling while time 
  travel playback.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Time travel archives now contain city 
  files. Earlier the contents of the file was merged with the DMO log files. 
  This improves the playback of successive time travel segments.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When running in a window the mouse 
  cursor changes to a &quot;wait state&quot; (e.g. an hourglass) in more situations than 
  previously.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where ToonTalk crashed 
  while exiting if the Magic Wand had just been dropped.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Demos and time travel archives of 
  robots that had more than 4 temporary items (e.g. placed on the ground) now 
  replay correctly.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/5</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the way non-time travel 
    demos are saved internally.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes demos and time travel 
    involving adding and removing pictures to pictures didn't replay exactly 
    correctly.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem in replaying demos 
    and time travel where the collision sensor didn't go on or off exactly at 
    the same time.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/5</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling during 
    replay of demos and time travel.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When training a robot with a box 
    containing sensors with numeric or textual values, the box in the robot's 
    thought bubble has ordinary text or number pads rather than sensors in it. 
    (Since sensors in a thought bubble don't make much sense and are costly and 
    confusing.)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling when 
    starting ToonTalk on a computer without the &quot;My Documents&quot; folder.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where sometimes after 
    pausing and returning to ToonTalk the built-in sounds were mixed up so 
    sometimes the wrong sound was played.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Removed a spurious warning that 
    sometimes was placed in the log file when loading remote controls.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When recording a new time line the 
    new line no longer contains unneeded city files.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">6/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a city was saved or a time travel 
  segment boundary caused a city to be saved where a bird has set down her 
  message to remove things from her nest then it didn't restore properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Time travel didn't always replay 
  correctly when a boundary occurred while Tooly had just run off screen before 
  you stood up.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If something was dropped on the remote 
  control for the looks of a picture that isn't on screen (e.g. on the floor of 
  another house) then it sometimes waited to finish the drop until you entered that 
  house. Also improved the error handling if something goes wrong in this case.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduce the day before 
  that caused some bugs with sensors changing allegiance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when a large team of robots 
  is stopped and dropped on the floor only some of the robots &quot;know&quot; that 
  they've stopped and they animated incorrectly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a related bug when a large team 
  of robots is running on the back of a picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a recently introduced bug that 
  caused the dropping of a box on a robot on the back of a picture to be 
  ignored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where sometimes a freshly 
  copied text pad had text was displayed beyond the edges of the text pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem restoring a city 
  accurately while Tooly is moving on the floor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem replaying demos and 
  time travel that sometimes occurred when fixed width font text pads were 
  involved and were recorded in Windows 2000/XP and replayed in Windows 98/Me 
  (or vice versa). Also new version is much faster when manipulating fixed width 
  font text pads.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The command line option
  <a href="command.htm#MustBeNewUser">-must_be_new_user</a> caused spurious 
  warnings to be generated in log files.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where sometimes nests

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">12/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">An erased picture in a thought bubble 
  no longer matches a flipped picture. (Except for robots trained in earlier 
  versions of ToonTalk.) This makes it possible to have a robot react 
  differently to flipped and unflipped pictures.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug the occurs sometimes when&nbsp; 
  a robot is trained on a box containing sensors together with the text or 
  number pad they are sensing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when the parts or containers 
  sensors are placed on the back of a picture they weren't updated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The parts and containers sensors can 
  be &quot;flipped&quot; to control whether they are sensing the front or back of a 
  picture. This wasn't always saved correctly so when restoring a city or object 
  the sensors may be sensing the back rather than the front.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes the containers remote 
  control would display as black.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The </font><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">containers </font>
  </big>

  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">remote now senses containers that are not 
  pictures -- e.g. boxes. Except for robots created in older versions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The containers sensor was limited to 
  64K levels of containment. Limit is now larger than could possibly fit in 
  memory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem loading a notebook 
  containing long-distance birds.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem caused sometimes by

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">14/5</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Under some circumstances when a bird 
  on the floor was given something she didn't return to exactly the same spot.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes a bird returning to a hole 
  in a box didn't display at the correct location.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where some changes to 
  sensors that display non-numeric values caused ToonTalk to occasionally 
  freeze.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now erase a flipped picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where demos and time 
  travel didn't always replay correctly if some of your actions were affected by 
  bumping into a wall.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error recovery when 
  replaying someone else's time travel archive. (This accidentally caused other 
  error recovery problems when replaying time travel until fixed on 6/6.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When loading and an externally 
  referenced object is missing, the resulting objects now has clearer text 
  explaining what happened. And the text is nicely centered when appropriate.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/6</font></p>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">F7 (to hurry things up) interfered 
  with the correct behaviour of birds when delivering something to a non-empty 
  nest.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where if different 
  parts of a time travel archive were produced with different versions of 
  ToonTalk that later segments recorded that they were created with earlier 
  versions. Sometimes caused inaccurate replay.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If operation was dropped on an erased 
  numerical operation it became a number rather than remaining an operation.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug caused by F11 to undo the 
  bamming of a number on a text pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes typing to a text pad that 
  had been flipped did cause it to change size properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem were the remote looks 
  of number's good size was that of a text pad with 1 on it regardless of how 
  digits the number had.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem in the puzzle game 
  where if you did something not allowed (e.g. use the keyboard in those puzzles 
  that prohibit using the keyboard) then the feedback sound began to play 
  repeatedly. Bug introduced on 20/2/04.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes the remote control for the 
  looks of a text pad displayed text beyond the edges of the text pad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where the sound of 
  using Pumpy sometimes played repeatedly even after done using him.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Control-s caused confusion when

  earlier versions.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can now type numbers even if the 
  intermediate states are syntactically incorrect. It is only when dropped or 
  when deselected does the newly typed number get updated. If the result is 
  syntactically incorrect the number reverts to its previous value. </font><big>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Variable width text pads that are not 
  black or whose pad is invisible save to the clipboard as an XML encoding

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where the variable

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the error handling for text 
  pads containing &quot;]]&gt;&quot; saved in earlier versions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced on 10/6 that

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes while in full-screen mode 
  ToonTalk displays a dialog while shutting down (e.g. about seeing hints or the

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you made a Java applet of a

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When you use Pumpy to make something a 
  &quot;good size&quot; then it keeps the center of the object at the same place. Now it

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot is trained to type an 
  extended key or the keyboard's number pad to a text pad other than those used 
  for editing (arrow keys and delete) then extra letters appeared.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you trained a robot to alter a 
  number using the operations on the keyboard's number pad (e.g. /, *, and -) 
  then the robot also remembered the insertion of a letter (e.g. 'j' when the 
  number pad '*' was typed).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If anything other than a box is 
  dropped on an erased notebook, you once again get a nice warning (broken since 
  27/2).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where sensor/picture

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a couple sentences that Marty 
  speaks that referred to the old way of cycling through possible sensor values 
  using the space bar.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a very large number (over 5000 
  digits) is displayed then it used to put many repetitions of the warning that 
  ToonTalk may run slowly in the log file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot is renamed to consist only 
  of white space (e.g. just &quot; &quot;) then it Java applets for it were generated 
  incorrectly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">ToonTalk would crash if a number was 
  displayed (or typed to) if it had about 700,000 digits or more. The limit is 
  now over 7,000,000 digits and rather than crash the number now just displays 
  as &quot;Unable to display N digits. The 
  number itself should be fine but it can't be saved and restored. &quot; The 
  limit was doubled in early November.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with the UK English

  Marty was talking.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Removed a confusing and unnecessary

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a picture has a bigger picture on 
  top and that bigger picture includes pictures that are set to &quot;SHOW ALL&quot; then 
  sometimes the black background was displayed beyond the limits of the picture.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Optimized the display of pictures that

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you drop a team of robots on an 
  erased box, you end up with a box with a hole for each robot. This didn't work 
  for 0-holed erased boxes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced with 3.99 
  that caused some demos and time travel archives made in earlier versions of 
  ToonTalk to replay incorrectly. In particular, the new version of the 
  Exploding Houses demo now works again.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced on 16/8 
  that caused the button on Maggie the Magic Wand to appear at the wrong place 
  if loading a city that had been created at a different screen resolution.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Add a new Switch to toontalk.ini

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can no longer grab things off a

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can no longer grab a nest after 
  dropping something on it until that item has settled down on the nest. </font><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Doing so caused bugs.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Using Pumpy to make a bird a good size 
  was broken.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you repeatedly used the Magic Wand, 
  your wand would drift downward and things looked confusing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you picked up a number and typed a 
  lot of things to it then the number became broken and displayed strange 
  things. (Typically typing about 40 characters triggered this bug.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Extremely large (more than 64K pixels

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When an object is destroyed by Bammer, 
  then it is retained in a reduced form in case the user presses F11 to unbam. 
  If a nest was part of that object then birds became mixed up and an copy of 
  the bird begins to fly off and gets stuck. Also there was a memory leak in 
  this situation.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes ToonTalk generated a 
  spurious warning about a something not knowing about some of its parts.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a demo was being created when 
  ToonTalk crashed (or was ended via the Task Manager) then the demo was 
  unplayable. It is fixed the next time ToonTalk is run. This demo can be very 
  helpful in tracking down bugs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Updated three demos in the US, UK, SE,

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">16/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced several months 
  ago that prevented you from dropping a nest on a nest to merge them into one 
  (where each bird flies to the combined nest).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug caused by unbamming (via 
  F11) the merging of two nests.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug saving a city (or a time 
  travel segment boundary) when not on the floor. The problem was that when 
  loaded the tools were at the default setting (Bigger for Pumpy, Suck for 
  Dusty, and Copy for Maggie) regardless of what they were when saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a time travel replay problem 
  that caused minor replay problems at the boundaries between segments.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem replaying time travel 
  or demos where a frame took over 1 second to execute.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Repeated use of Maggie the Magic Wand 
  without waiting for the copying animation to complete caused the wand and hand 
  to drift up or down. (This is a rewrite and more general version of the 
  similar bug fixed on 13/9.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug caused by displaying 
  numbers wider than the screen. (Probably this was an asymptomatic bug where 
  incorrect parameters to the Windows API were ignored.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.111</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">17/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Updated ukver22.dll and usver22.dll 
  (and on 23/9 ptver22.dll as well) so that when Marty speak a sentence like 
  &quot;type '-' to change it&quot; the minus is now pronounced because he says </font><big>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">&quot;type '-' (minus) to change it&quot;. The 
  Portuguese version uses &quot;menos&quot;. Part of the 3.111 full installer.</font></big></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">24/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you were holding a box from the 
  middle and typed a digit to break the box then the remaining box may be far 
  from your hand (but still held). It now adjusts so you are holding it on the 
  edge.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When replaying time travel archives 
  ToonTalk performs a significant optimization when replaying successive 
  segments. This optimization doesn't apply if the next segment was recorded by 
  rewinding back and re-recording. ToonTalk now uses the optimal playback when a 
  segment boundary was due to re-recording but was subsequently recorded over by 
  going back further in time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">With the introduction in mid-June of 
  arrow key editing of numbers (and text pads) a bug was introduced where 
  ToonTalk crashes if you save a zero-character text pad (created by rubbing out 
  a single character), restore it, and then type to it.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">26/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot is holding a box types 
  a digit to break the box then the remaining box may be far from its hand (but 
  still held).</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Some animations were left in an 
  inconsistent state when you stand up. In particular, a bird may be adding 
  things to her nest and if you stand up, the bird may freeze or stop restoring 
  the nest after removing the stack to put something on the bottom.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed yet another bug involving the 
  display of objects that are more than 256 times larger than their normal or 
  good size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you pressed control-c while holding 
  the wand and then pressed control-v you would see two wands until you dropped 
  them. It was even more confusing if you typed control-c after the wand had 
  copied something but before it was dropped. Similar (but not quite as 
  confusing) things happened if you typed control-c and control-v while holding 
  Dusty, Pumpy, or Tooly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Restored the functionality of the <i>
  undocumented</i> command line feature &quot;-allow_multiple_toontalks 1&quot; which 
  allows you to run more than one ToonTalk at a time. Mostly useful for testing 
  long-distance birds on a single machine.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">27/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you were on the ground outside and 
  typed control-c followed by control-v then you saw a text pad with the XML 
  encoding for the city. The control-v is now ignored if the encoding of a city 
  is on the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If the <a href="ttini.htm#DefaultUser">
  DefaultUser</a> is to a non-existent directory then ToonTalk now checks if the 
  files are instead in the Users folder of the ToonTalk installation directory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The WebLabs ToonTalk FTP publishing 
  tool now looks in the Windows directory for tt_ftp.ini if it can't find it in 
  the My Documents\ToonTalk folder and copies it over if needed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.112 and Beta 45. Only 
  difference is that Beta 45 expires 75 days after installation.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><a name="Beta46">28/9</a></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem with trial and beta

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">29/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced on 16/9 
  that caused the narration and subtitles of demos to occur at the wrong time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added error handling for dealing with 
  failure to write files (possibly due to a full device or folder protection).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when you click on the Record 
  button in time travel, ToonTalk freezes for a couple minutes (as the archive 
  is copied and updated). The mouse cursor no longer disappears and it shows an 
  hour glass now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes (e.g. when loading a complex 
  city) ToonTalk appears to freeze when starting (and in some cases the screen 
  is black for a few seconds). A message saying that ToonTalk is loading and to 
  wait now appears on the screen.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.113. (And a modified 
  version of Beta 45 called 45b which differs only in that it includes the 
  latest (and safest) version of Microsoft's gdiplus.dll and it expires in 75 
  days not 60.)</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">30/9</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Typing control-v while the clipboard 
  holds the XML of a saved city, switches to that city. Note that you can save a 
  city while outside by typing control-c (if on the ground your hand must be 
  empty).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can once again type control-v 
  while the clipboard holds the XML of a saved house to create a copy of the 
  house near where you are standing. Note you can save a house to the clipboard 
  by typing control-c while standing in the house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Made further improvements to the error 
  handling when ToonTalk is unable to write files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Introduced the
  <a href="ttini.htm#DoNotWarnAboutInabilityToWriteUserFiles">
  DoNotWarnAboutInabilityToWriteUserFiles</a> toontalk.ini Switch.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced on 26/9 that

</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">1/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced on 26/9

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where number and text 
  pads when seen from the helicopter sometimes display parts too large.</font></li>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Made further improvements to the 
  error handling when ToonTalk is unable to write files.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes Bammer would come out when a 
  robot with an attached tool (common in some of the puzzles) was dropped on 
  something resulting in a crash.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If UserFiles is set, then ToonTalk no 
  longer writes crash reports or temporary files to the default ToonTalk 
  subfolder of My Documents.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.114.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">4/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you train a robot to copy something 
  in Tooly using Maggie the Magic Wand (rather than just picking it up) then the 
  animation of the robot showed the thing copied by the wand attached far from 
  the end of the wand.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you saved or put the main notebook 
  on the clipboard then if you loaded it into a different user name (or a 
  different computer) then any user-defined notebooks in the main notebook 
  became empty.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you dropped a box with a nest in it 
  just after a bird dropped something into the nest then sometimes the box acted 
  like it was dropped on the thing that the bird dropped. For example, if the 
  bird is dropping the number 2 and the box has more than 2 holes then it'll 
  break after 2 holes because it was (mistakenly interpreted as having been) 
  dropped on the 2.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Updated the FTP Publishing Tool to 
  give better error messages when there are problems with the tt_ftp.ini file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Flipping over a picture with pictures 
  that have pictures on top and some robots running on the back caused things to 
  be displayed strangely (sometimes things became invisible or flickered).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.115.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">5/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where it is possible 
  to set a robot that is to be retrained to allow only 0 steps and hence is 
  untrainable.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot is being retrained and 
  exits in the middle of using of a tool, the robot may be in a state where 
  ToonTalk crashes when the robot is saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you retrained a robot and Marty 
  appeared to explain about training robots and you didn't move the mouse then 
  Marty sometimes appeared and disappeared a few times while saying good bye.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Under special circumstances with 
  numbers being added and removed from a nest, ToonTalk could crash while 
  displaying an uncovered number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Made several small improvements to 
  some image files. Some are smaller and look as good. Others look better 
  without being bigger. Available only via full or beta version installer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Released 3.116.</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">7/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes if a robot on the floor 
  where the programmer is drops something on top of a stack of things on a nest 
  and a bird has removed the stack to put something on the bottom, then the 
  robot drops the item on the floor rather than on the top item of the stack.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you changed the screen resolution 
  of ToonTalk and then logged in as the same user, sometimes things in notebooks 
  open on the floor were the wrong size until the page is flipped (and flipped 
  back). This seems to only have happened if the thing has parts that are 
  outside its bounding box (e.g. robots and their thought bubble or trucks and 
  their cargo).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you changed the screen resolution 
  of ToonTalk and then logged in as the same user with time travel enabled, then 
  occasionally old segments didn't replay perfectly well. Now the old screen 
  resolution is used to avoid this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you changed the screen resolution 
  of ToonTalk and then logged in as the same user then moved on the floor to 
  where the walls are visible they were displayed with the wrong size.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved and shortened the wording of 
  the warning to wait while things are loading.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The error handling when unable to 
  write a file (introduced a week earlier) sometimes produced a spurious warning 
  when all was well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The DirectDraw error &quot;The previous 
  blit operation that is transferring information to or from this surface is 
  incomplete.&quot; no longer causes an abnormal termination.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">8/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you turned Maggie the Magic Wand by 
  pressing the space bar while there was nothing under the tip of the wand (e.g. 
  you missed the target) and the wand is not in &quot;self-copying&quot; mode then the 
  wand wouldn't work until dropped and picked up. Also you now hear a &quot;plop&quot; 
  sound when trying to copying nothing (using the keyboard -- the mouse 
  interface already did this).</font></li>
  <li><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you turned Maggie the Magic 
  Wand by a mouse button (an option available via 'Set Options') while there was 
  nothing under the tip of the wand (e.g. you missed the target) and the wand is 
  not in &quot;self-copying&quot; mode then the wand would drift upwards and it attempted 
  to copy nothing.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when jumping between time 
  travel segments you saw the hand and arm displayed separated or overlapping.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a time travel replay bug that 
  can be caused by copying a bird which has no nest (e.g. in a thought bubble). 
  The problem was that the nest was made by the bird .25 seconds faster than 
  when originally recorded often causing larger problems latter.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">9/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes when exiting ToonTalk, it 
  needs to save various files and this can take a noticeable amount of time. The 
  cursor now turns into a hourglass upon exit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When Marty describes a non-numeric 
  remote control, he often said the same sentence twice. And he didn't use the 
  new convention that '-' is followed by '(minus)' so it is spoken properly. 
  Also if ToonTalk is customized to treat all mouse buttons the same then the 
  sentence describing how to change these values was missing a phrase.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug introduced many months 
  earlier that caused the &quot;hit or miss&quot; sensors to display as black until the 
  object involved first touches something else. If the sensor wasn't in a box 
  then its size was wrong as a result.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">10/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Found additional cases where errors 
  reading or writing files were not handled well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a user does not have the file 
  privileges to write to Windows 'Shared Documents' folder (but at least one 
  earlier user did have the ability to write to it) then ToonTalk would crash 
  when displaying the time travel buttons or when user defined pictures or 
  sounds were brought into ToonTalk. Also improved the error handling and advise 
  in dialog screens if this occurs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you save a city while pointing to a 
  picture in a notebook (or a time travel segment occurs at such a time) then

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When a number is dropped on an erased 
  text pad the text pad displays the number. If the number was displayed with 
  shrinking digits, then the coercion to a text pad resulted in an approximation 
  (where the number of decimal places depended upon the size of the number pad). 
  The text pad now displays the equivalent fractional value. The old behavior 
  can be obtained by setting <a href="ttini.htm#NumberToTextConversionIsExact">
  NumberToTextConversionIsExact</a> to 0.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Since December some warnings end up 
  repeated many times in the user log file. Such as the warning that very large 
  numbers can cause ToonTalk to freeze briefly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If an empty file (0 bytes) is put on

<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Improved the way Marty described how 
  to modify the mouse buttons using the shift and control buttons. (Only needed 
  if ToonTalk is customized via 'Set Options' so that all mouse buttons are 
  treated the same.) Applies to the US, UK, PT, and SE versions of ToonTalk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Localized the warnings produced when 
  ToonTalk fails to read or write files to Swedish (thanks Lennart) and 
  Portuguese (thanks Leonel).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Spurious warnings were generated 
  loading a city where a large team of robots (at least three or four robots) 
  were working when it was saved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where very large text

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a tool (e.g. Maggie the Magic Wand)

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The time travel replay bug fixed on 
  16/10 broke some older demos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The toontalk.ini Switch
  <a href="ttini.htm#ExitWhenDemoEnds">ExitWhenDemoEnds</a> was ignored when 
  replaying someone's time travel demo. Also you now can set this option via <a href="command.htm#ExitAtEndOfDemo">-exit_at_end_of_demo</a> 
  on the command line as well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If ToonTalk encounters a problem 
  (without crashing) then depending upon the type of user (set by 'Set 
  Options'), ToonTalk now zips up the files that would be useful in tracking 
  down the problem and encourages the user to send it to support@toontalk.com.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where sometimes when 
  standing a robot floats above the box he's working on. And then when you sit 
  again it sometimes in under and sometimes over. And it was sometimes different 
  during recording and replaying of a demo or during time travel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you typed some text to a text pad 
  or a label and then used the arrow keys (available since </font><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">11/6)

  sometimes nonsense resulted.</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you save a city while entering or 
  leaving a thought bubble and the tools are inside of Tooly, then when that

  thought bubble. This broke some time travel archives. The fix only applies to 
  time travel archives made in 3.121 or later.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug where sometimes a robot 
  used the wrong notebook. (Could only happen when a saved city was loaded in.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot was working and you grabbed 
  his box sometimes he would end up confused and Marty would say give a 
  misleading explanation. A confused robot stayed confused until you picked him 
  up and dropped him.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marty sometimes referred to a robot in 
  front of you as a robot in another house.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When Marty is in the mode with 
  speaking and subtitles then sometimes the subtitle would stay up until the 
  next time Marty had something to say.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Added an undocumented feature that 
  saves a city when a demo ends. This is useful for creating automatic tests of 
  new ToonTalk releases.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If ToonTalk exited abnormally during 
  time travel then the next time that user runs, ToonTalk tries to replay the 
  last segment. If something goes wrong with the replay then sometimes ToonTalk 
  would exit prematurely.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you picked up a number, typed to 
  it, and pressed F1 then Marty would describe the number as it was prior to 
  being typed to.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you are holding a shrinking decimal 
  then Marty would suggest you type backspace to edit it when you can't edit 
  these numbers (since they are infinitely long).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you are holding a negative number 
  then Marty suggested you can make it positive to subtract it from another 
  number. (True but very confusing.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you are holding zero then Marty no 
  longer suggests you might want to divide it into another number.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you are holding a shrinking decimal 
  then Marty would sometimes show and speak as if it were a fraction&nbsp; and 
  at other times as an exact decimal (typically with nearly 100 digits). Now he 
  always refers to it as a fraction.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Sometimes things would go wrong when 
  Marty tried to talk about negative fractions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a city was saved (or a time travel 
  segment boundary occurred) while a robot was in the middle of typing something 
  to an object then sometimes the previous typing was ignored.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The 'Set Options' dialog screen for 
  choosing a voice for Marty didn't show all the available choices. And it now 
  displays the mode name and speaker name since some manufacturers of speech 
  engines use one as a unique friendly name and others use the other.</font></li>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">29/10</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a robot has an empty nest in his 
  thought bubble and he is given a box with an empty nest in the corresponding 
  location he'll accept the box. But if the box given to him also contains an 
  empty nest that matches some other object then the robot waits for something 
  to arrive. If in the meanwhile something arrives on the first nest causing the 
  robot to no longer match he didn't notice until you gave him the box over 
  again (or if he was on the back of a picture if you dropped the picture).
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a number is edited, then it becomes 
  the new number when dropped or when you move your hand away from the number. 
  It now also becomes the new number if other things happen to it such as a 
  robot dropping something on top.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If you gave a robot a box with a 
  sensor for the looks of a picture that is showing the front of the picture and 
  the picture is flipped then it would not match an identical picture in the 
  robot's thought bubble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem where a robot that 
  matches against a sensor or empty nest and then waits because it encounters an 
  empty nest where it expected a value then that robot may have run twice when 
  it finally does match.</font></li>

  a ToonTalk session.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The FTP publishing tool now puts up 
  the information screen that it may take a while to upload the file before 
  connecting to the FTP server. (It used to do it just before transferring the 
  file itself.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Introduced a new number display 
  feature where numbers that have too many digits to display in the space they 
  have use a scheme where the digits shrink and then grow. Thanks to Ana Isabel 
  Sacristan for the suggestion. This feature can be turned off using the
  <a href="ttini.htm#OKToDisplayNumbersShrinkingAndGrowing">
  OKToDisplayNumbersShrinkingAndGrowing</a> toontalk.ini switch. This also 
  displays fractions vertically. Note that this feature is only available in

  the same problem for numbers so large that they took too long and when a 
  number was too large to compute the digits needed -- about 6 million digits).</font></big></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">If a number is very large and part of

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a problem introduced in February 
  that prevented birds from accepting non-numeric sensors directly (in a box

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a similar bug (also from 
  February) that prevented you from dropping a copy of the magic wand on a fresh 
  untrained robot to give him the tool as an initial tool. (Used in creating 
  puzzles mostly.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Some non-numeric sensors can be 
  coerced to a number by dropping them on an erased number pad. (E.g. addresses

  fewer lines then the older subtitle was partially still displayed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">You can only drop a box on an erased 
  notebook (so each item in the box ends up a different page). ToonTalk no 
  longer gives incorrect wiggle feedback if you hold something else over an

  robots with the magic wand in the puzzle game) are trained to leave things on 
  the floor to be vacuumed up then when running the robot after vacuuming tries 
  to pick up the wand and could get confused.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Fixed a bug caused by grabbing

  the resolution ToonTalk instead ran at 1280x960 (or tried to -- if in 
  full-screen mode DirectX refused to switch to that resolution you got a

  standard resolutions are 4x3 except this one.)</font></li>

  the the &quot;File to Picture&quot; sensor (renamed &quot;File to Object on 19/12) then for 
  many months the file is turned into a ToonTalk object even if it isn't a

  just local file names.</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">

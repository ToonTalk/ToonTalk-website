the Split robot</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you pick up the <a href="split.htm">Split</a> 
robot and type F1 to call for Marty he'll say:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You are holding a robot who wants a box with 3 
  holes. The hole labeled with &quot;In&quot; contains any number. The hole labeled with 
  &quot;Out1&quot; contains a bird. The hole labeled with &quot;Out2&quot; contains a bird. If given 
  a box like that he will pick up what's in the first hole inside his box. And 
  give it to the bird in the second hole inside his box. And pick up what's in 
  the second hole inside his box. And drop it. And pick up what's in the third 
  hole inside his box. And drop it on the second hole inside his box. And pick 
  up the last thing he made or found. And drop it on the third hole inside his 
  box. </font></p>

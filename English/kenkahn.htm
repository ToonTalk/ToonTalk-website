<p>ToonTalk was designed and built by Ken Kahn who, after earning a doctorate in computer
science from MIT, has spent over 30 years as a researcher in programming languages, computer
animation, and programming systems for children. He has been a faculty member at MIT,
University of Stockholm, and Uppsala University. For over eight years he was a researcher
at Xerox PARC. He has made several animated films that have been shown in film festivals,
theaters, and cable TV. In 1992, Ken founded <a HREF="address.htm">Animated Programs</a>
whose mission is to make computer programming child's play. He received a patent covering
the underlying technology of <a HREF="toontalk.htm">ToonTalk</a> (US Patent Number
5,517,663).</p>

<p>He has participated in several international research projects (Playground,
WebLabs, ReMath, and <a href="https://project.ecraft2learn.eu/">eCraft2Learn</a>)
and several UK projects (the BBC Digital Curriculum Project and <a href="http://modelling4all.org">Modelling4All</a>).
He has extended a blocks-based language to enable <a href="https://ecraft2learn.github.io/ai/">beginners to build AI programs</a>.
</p>

  <p>In 2025 he published <a href="https://cmkpress.com/product/learners-apprentice/">The Learner's Apprentice: AI and the Amplification of Human Creativity</a>.
  It is about how students can use chatbots to create apps, adventures, illustrated stories, and structured conversations.

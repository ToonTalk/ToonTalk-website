<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can run ToonTalk in a way that treats the 
mouse input as screen locations. This is called the absolute mouse mode. The 
normal behavior of ToonTalk is to pay attention only to differences in mouse 
position. We call this the relative mouse mode.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In absolute mouse mode you click where you want to fly,
walk, or move your hand. If you are on the floor and click on an object your hand moves
there and you pick up the object. You can then click again to where you want to move the
object. Another click will drop it. To use a tool like <a href="dusty.htm">Dusty</a>
in this manner, click to pick him up, click again to move him to where you want him to be,
then press a key to turn him on, and another key to turn him off.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In absolute mouse mode you can also drag things around by
keeping the pointer (or mouse button) down. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If while your character is walking inside a room you click
near the bottom of the screen, your character will sit down. While your character is
sitting and you see the wall in front of you, you can click on the wall to stand up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To switch to absolute mouse mode just set the switch <a
href="ttini.htm#AbsoluteMouseMode">AbsoluteMouseMode</a> to 1. If you are trying this mode
with a real mouse as opposed to a stylus or touch sensitive screen, then you probably also
want to set <a href="ttini.htm#ShowMouseCursor">ShowMouseCursor</a> to 1. Setting them
back to 0 will restore the installation to relative mouse mode (its normal state).</font></p>

Thanks. Now see if you can make a box with 8, 16, and 32 inside.

We need
 #####.

This is the result of saving everything in a room.

   The following is a box with 3 holes whose first hole contains the number
8 and whose second hole contains the number 16 and whose third hole
contains the number 32.

Did you know that boxes click together when you drop
one on the side of another?  Make sure they overlap just a little
bit. That might help.

OK, here's what I'd do.  I'd drop the 16 on a 16 that's in a box.
Then I'd drop the box with 8 on the left side of the one with 16.
Then I'd drop the box with 32 on the right side of the other box.
That should do it.  I'd do it myself, if my arm wasn't broken.

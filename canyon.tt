   This is the result of "pasting" a ToonTalk object. You can include
this in files, email, or whatever. To decode it just use any program
that can copy this to Window's clipboard. For example, you can use
Window's Notepad or Write program. Just be sure your selection includes
the code below and then select the Copy command in the Edit menu. 
Then it will appear in the ToonTalk remote control for the clipboard. 
Just use Dusty to vacuum it off the clipboard. 
   The following is a movie of a switch which is partly visible. The first
thing on the back is a box with 3 holes. The hole labeled with "On?"
contains a remote control for which picture or color is shown. The hole
labeled with "Next" contains a sound "play c:\windows\media\canyon.mid".
The hole labeled with "Saved" contains a sound "close all". And the
second thing on the back is a robot who wants a box with 3 holes. The
hole labeled with "On?" contains the number 1. The hole labeled with
"Next" contains a sound "play c:\windows\media\canyon.mid". The hole
labeled with "Saved" contains a sound "close all".  If given a box like
that he will pick up what's in the second hole inside his box.  And push
' ' to change what he is holding.  And drop it.  And pick up what's in
the third hole inside his box.  And drop it on the second hole inside
his box.  And pick up the last thing he made or found.  And drop it on
the third hole inside his box. Otherwise, he'll give the box to the
robot behind him in line. The second robot wants a box with 3 holes. The
hole labeled with "On?" contains the number 0. The hole labeled with
"Next" contains a sound "close all". The hole labeled with "Saved"
contains a sound "play c:\windows\media\canyon.mid".  If given a box
like that he will pick up what's in the second hole inside his box.  And
push ' ' to change what he is holding.  And drop it.  And pick up what's
in the third hole inside his box.  And drop it on the second hole inside
his box.  And pick up the last thing he made or found.  And drop it on
the third hole inside his box. .

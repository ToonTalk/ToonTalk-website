include comments, suggestions, or bug reports regarding any aspect of the
ToonTalk system.  Feel free to show the system to anyone but you do not
have the right to distribute it to anyone else without prior permission.

The beta software will refuse to run after 60 days.  Warnings will begin
to appear two weeks earlier. All software is provided as is and no one is
liable for any bugs.

As a reward for providing good feedback, you are entitled to a free copy of
the final ToonTalk product after it is released.

3. Installation instructions.  
You need a PC running a 32-bit version of Microsoft Windows (Win95,
Win98, NT 4.0, and Windows 2000 work).  It works best in 256 color
mode.  It can run with 8 megabytes of memory but slowly.  It can run
on a 486 but it will be slow.  You'll need at least 40 megabytes of
free hard disk storage.

To install from a CDROM just run ClickMe.

If you are installing from files obtained over the internet then run
beta30.exe. You can delete beta30.exe after installation.

The 32 bit version of ToonTalk for Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, or
later systems is now the only version in the beta release.

Good luck.

4. Customization options.

When you start up ToonTalk it asks your name.  You will also see a
button labeled "Set Options" which can be used to customize ToonTalk.

DirectX.  These are Microsoft extensions to Windows for games. The 32
bit version of ToonTalk requires these.  They come pre-installed on
Windows 4.0 and Windows 98. This beta version requires DirectX version
7 or 8. (Though it will run in DirectX 3 but some features will be
disabled.)  Also for some older versions of DirectX and certain video
cards it is recommended that you put Windows at the same resolution as
ToonTalk (e.g. 800x600) and run Windows with 256 colors.  Visit
www.microsoft.com/DirectX for more information on DirectX.

Tips.
The Martian will give a complete description of an item if you call for him
(via F1) while holding or pointing to an item.  This is particularly useful
for getting a description of what a robot does.

The 'Pause' button is a convenient way to pause or quit a demo or
session with ToonTalk.

Bugs.  If you edit your \windows\toontalk.ini file to change the line
GenerateLogs=0
to 
GenerateLogs=3
Then then last 3 runs of ToonTalk will be rerunable.  They will be named
log1.dmo, log2.dmo, and log3.dmo.  Check creation dates to see which is the
most recent.  If you have captured a bug in a DMO file then please send it
to me.  It is a binary file -- if you need help sending it please send
email to support@toontalk.com.

Uninstall. 
You can click on the icon "Remove ToonTalk from Computer".
Or you can run add/remove programs from the control panel.

Readings.
Check out http://www.toontalk.com.

There are several papers about ToonTalk available via anonymous ftp from
csli.stanford.edu.  See www.toontalk.com/English/papers.htm for details.

Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 4.0 SP1) (part of the first
release of Windows 98) sometimes has an "Invalid Page Fault" when
attempting to run a Java applet generated by ToonTalk. Sometimes the
browser hangs or reports a Java error. You can select "Internet
Options" under the "View" menu, click on the Advanced Tab, and scroll
down to "Java JIT compiler enabled". Make sure the check mark is
removed. This should fix the problem but it will slow down all Java
applets. This Internet Explorer bug has been reported to Microsoft.

To all my beta testers.

Last words.
Enjoy and create neat things!  And send me the neat things and I'll post
them on the web page for others to see and use.
